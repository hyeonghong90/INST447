Don’t waste your money, the constant headache isnt worth it.It either scrolls and stops and then wont scroll in that specific window (Chrome or otherwise) or it jumps so erratically that you’re better off scrolling in reverse to get where you want to go. And only fix for the no scrolling is to close out the application or window and try again.If you scroll down 2 lines it would scroll down once and then scroll you up 3-4 lines.Initially it would only do it once in a while, usually small enough you might not even notice it, but over time it happens more and more often and the jumps become more erratic and drastic till its completely unusable.Product still looks new and clean has no signs of wear to warrant the scroll not functioning.I have otherwise tried every possible solution; reinstalling the mouse, the drivers, alt mouse settings, wheel scroll settings, plugging the mouse in a different port you name it outside of opening the mouse entirely I’ve tried it to get a fix.

Very good left and right button feel:  light but precise.  Excellent tracking on nearly any surface.  Mouse pads are sooo 90s.One quirk but not serious enough to delete a star:  A light push down on the scroll wheel switches from manual to auto scroll.  Sometimes this gets in the way but there seems no way to disable this feature on my computer (2017 Dell desktop).This is a wireless mouse, not a Bluetooth mouse.  In my experience, wireless mice (and other devices) connect nearly instantly with computer.  Bluetooth devices sometimes are hard to connect and may take some time to hook up.  In my opinion, Bluetooth is over rated;  wireless uses a different radio technology in the 2.4GHz band and is transparent to the user.In this case the mouse is ready to use as soon as you turn it on with the small switch on the underside.One difference:  HP appears to use infrared (like your TV remote) instead of visible light for mouse tracking.  You can't tell if the mouse is on or off by looking for a light. You have to check the switch position.  Not a disadvantage, just different.\",\n",
