B06XGYQWZN,Sony Xperia L1 - Unlocked Smartphone - 16GB - Black (US Warranty),153.99,2017-09-05T00:00:00Z,Solid value priced choice,4,0,"Call connection is clear, but the sound quality isnâ€™t the best. The speaker is at the bottom of the phone and sounds fuzzy/muffled even on high volume. Headphones or a Bluetooth speaker are highly recommended for music. HD video playback can be laggy, especially without a good WiFi connection. The battery is terrible and needs to be charged daily if the phone is being used regularly. Conveniently, the L1 comes with a battery saver and data saver option that really help with the bad battery life. The slide the SIM card fits into is quite difficult to pull out. The manual says use your fingernails to pry the slide out, but I could not do this without tweezers. Aesthetically, the L1 is pretty. Rectangular, but with rounded edges, similar to the old Nokia Lumia phones. Itâ€™s also lightweight but the materials are on the cheap side, and the screen most definitely cracks if dropped in a parking lot.  Overall, this is an excellent value-priced smart phone with decent visual appeal.",2

To start off this phone is slow after a while. The built in keyboard sometimes just stops working... So your only choice is to restart the phone a couole of times until the keyboard comes back. Every time you will receive a MMS the messaging app will stop working and will keep cashing if you try to opwn the message where you just received the MMS. I have tried to contact Xperia Support and they just BS you. They find excuses on why this is happening. Their employees have no knowledge they are most of the time not useful. I also tried to reboot on factory settings this phone and the issue always come back... I do not recommend this phone. It's a wast of $200. There are other phones at the same price that will make a better job.,0

B06XGYQWZN,Sony Xperia L1 - Unlocked Smartphone - 16GB - Black (US Warranty),153.99,2017-12-09T00:00:00Z,Good value with some premium features,4,0,"Pros:Camera is slightly above expectationsNo bloatwareAndroid 7.0 Nougat, With November 2017 Security UpdatePerformance (for price point)Screen sizeConstruction is all plastic, but very durableNFCUSB-C PortCons:No fingerprint sensorFace scanner doesn't work in low-light conditionsWill not receive Android OreoDoes not include quick charger in the boxOverall, I am very happy with the phone, especially at this price point.  I believe this is one of the best value smartphones currently out, assuming you are not a power user. Sony is typically generous with software and security updates, but this phone will not be receiving Android 8.0 Oreo.The display on this phone is 5.5 inches, putting it in the size category of flagship phones. However, the screen resolution is only HD 720p, which is quite a bit below the pixel density of flagship phones. However, Sony is using a very good screen on this phone, with great white balance and viewing angles.I'm using the phone on AT&T, and it has full connectivity over LTE. The lack of a fingerprint sensor is an annoyance, but that is a reasonable sacrifice for such a good value. Facial recognition seems to work fine for me in well-lit areas, but does not work at all in low-light situations.Performance is what you'd expect for this class of phone - there are occasional stutters, but they don't hamper day-to-day use. Battery charges quickly with a quick charger, but the charger included in the box works at a standard, slow speed. The phone seems to hold a charge all day with normal use, which is in part due to the lower resolution screen.  This phone includes support for NFC, which is quite rare at this price point. This allows you to use Android Pay in stores, as well as share files with other NFC-supporting phones.This phone is a great value at this price point, especially if you want USB-C and a large screen, but do not want a flagship. If you are looking for sheer amount of features, there may be better options at this price point. Sony quality, in my experience, is worth a small price premium.",0

B01NCISWQT,Vitagene DNA Test Kit:  Ancestry + Health Personal Genetic Reports,49.83,2018-03-22T00:00:00Z,Best DNA kit with add on insights!!,5,1,"I have been wanting to look into my DNA for months now, ever since the fad has hit the market. I thought that I would just want to know my background, but this DNA kit is much more than just finding out your genetics. This DNA kit gave me an insight of everything that I needed to know regarding my genetics and health profiles.I had my first baby over 6 months ago and have been having a hard time losing this baby weight. It has never been an issue for me to lose weight, in fact I have been thin most of my life, so this added weight put a damper on my mood, especially when dieting and exercising was not helping. After utilizing this DNA kit, and finding out more about my body, it has helped me find out what I need to do with my diet plans to help me lose this baby weight. Since changing my dieting rituals to coincide with my genetics, it has helped me lose weight and get back into my pre-baby weight and clothes!This kit was so easy to use. All you have to do is take the swaps, swap each check, and put the swabs into the vials given. Plus, it comes with a pre-paid box to send back to the lab.Overall, this DNA kit has given me much more insights about my genetics than I thought it could. It is well worth the price tag, when you look into the lifelong information it gives you about your genetics.",0
B01NCISWQT,Vitagene DNA Test Kit:  Ancestry + Health Personal Genetic Reports,49.83,2018-03-22T00:00:00Z,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,1,0,"Wow. TOTAL waste of money. As a previous commenter noted, the health/wellness information could have come from a 7th grade Health textbook. Considering I answered a VERY long questionnaire for them AND they HAVE MY DNA, for goodness' sake, the report was extremely generic and unhelpful. Even considering all the information I gave them -- for one example, weight training 3 times a week -- my daily protein recommendation was 46 grams. I am a small female, but for anyone who knows the LEAST LITTLE BIT about nutrition, that will barely help me maintain enough muscle to get out of bed in the morning, not to mention I'm 47 yoa and we need more protein as we age for bone health. It's actually laughable if I hadn't paid them for something I didn't get. The health/wellness portion is lacking SO much, it makes me doubt that the ancestry portion is even true. If you get nothing else from this review, please heed this warning--DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! Just pay more money for a company like DNAfit.",0
B01NCISWQT,Vitagene DNA Test Kit:  Ancestry + Health Personal Genetic Reports,49.83,2018-03-23T00:00:00Z,"Swab, Scrape and Send",5,1,"When you receive the kit, the first thing you need to do is activate it online using a unique code posted on the kit. The code is used to keep your sample anonymous but trackable throughout the process. Next, you fill in your information on the Vitagene webpage and answer a few questions related to lifestyle. Once you've finished activating your kit and setting up your account, it's time to extract your sample, which involves scrapping the insides of both (mouth) cheeks with the provided swabs and placing them in the appropriate plastic tubes (also provided). The last step is to shake the tubes for about five seconds, place them in the collection bag, put the bag in the prepaid shipping box and then drop it off at the Post office. You can't eat, drink or smoke within 30 minutes of collecting samples. The whole process is quick and painless.Results can take a few weeks to receive considering the amount of information being gathered. Therefore, this is somewhat of a general review as I am still in the process for receiving mine and will update after looking them over. The Vitagene DNA Test Kit was affordable relative to others like it, so I figured it was worth a go and so far I'm impressed with how easy the process has been.",0

I exercise by walking and hiking but is it enough?  I don't diet but I do try to eat healthy.I submitted the dna test kit and am waiting for my results.  You take a very quick questionnaire and when the results come in, you will get diet, exercise and supplement reports, in addition to the genetic and ancestry reports.  I'm so excited to see what the diet and exercise reports have to say- do I need a different fitness regime? Do I need to steer clear of certain foods or add certain supplements?Do I metabolize carbohydrates more slowly than others?

B01NCISWQT,Vitagene DNA Test Kit:  Ancestry + Health Personal Genetic Reports,49.83,2018-04-04T00:00:00Z,Looking forward to the report,4,1,"My family and I have been talking about the DNA test kits. I have been wanting to order one but it is difficult to pick between them. I saw this Vitagene DNA test kit and thought it was interesting because it had a lot of health-related testing and evaluation that it does. I went ahead and ordered the kit and it was here and only 2 days, thanks to Amazon Prime.I opened the kit to read the instructions. When I did so I noticed one of the two vials was empty. There are two vials you are supposed to put your samples in and they have a solution in them. However one vial had a loose cap. It had leaked all over the inside of the box. I called Vitagene and requested a replacement vial, but they said it was not critical that there be two samples. They provide two vials so if one sample is contaminated they have a second one. They said I should just go ahead and do the sample and send it in. I assume if the sample is not usable they will then send me two more vials. Kind of a pain, but I understand it is not practical for them to send another vial if they rarely need to rely on the second vial.Taking the sample was pretty easy. I just had to use the swabs on the inside of my cheeks, first the left than the right.  The kit includes a prepaid label on a small box and an envelope to seal the samples inside of to place in the Box. I did tape the box closed because there was no seal for the box and I was concerned it might crush and open in shipment.I also went online to the Vitagene website to register the sample.  Each of the two vials and the instruction card have a sample number on it. This number is used to register the sample in advance. It appears that they will notify me once the sample is received and processed. In looking at their website it looks like there is a wealth of information I will get once the sample is processed.For the moment I am optimistic that the sample will process fine and I will get some great information. I have only provided a four star rating because I'm disappointed at the sample vile being open and the fact that now I have to be concerned that the one sample will not be valid and there is no backup. Once I get my results I will update this review if necessary to increase or decrease the star rating.",0

It's so much more than a DNA Ancestry Kit. The packaging it came in was of high quality. The process was short and simple and the instructions made everything really easy to follow. All you have to do is swab placed in a tube and off they went. I didn't have to pay for shipping either since there was a prepaid return label.I got the results back in less than 2 weeks.

B01NCISWQT,Vitagene DNA Test Kit:  Ancestry + Health Personal Genetic Reports,49.83,2018-04-11T00:00:00Z,It's Worth Your Life...but BE INFORMED!,3,0,"At first, I was super disappointed in this product. The information I got was ""technically"" based off my DNA, but was extremely surface level in every way (with ancestry and health). So, I ended up taking the raw DNA file they gave me and ran it through Promethius for $10, which gave me IN DEPTH explanations as to what my DNA says. After reading my review, a guy from Vitagene gave me a call. We had an awesome and productive conversation, at the end of which, I got my money back. In that light, I decided to update my review so that you can be truly informed as you make a decision about Vitagene. Here's what you should know:1. REACH OUT TO VITAGENE FIRST: Email them at support@vitagene.com, ask your questions and request a phone call. It's worth the hassle, believe me. Vitagene heard me when I told them how disappointed I was that I got shallow information back and explained why I used Promethius, etc. The guy I talked to (who was great) stated that they are in the process now of trying to develop what Promethius does, which is essentially give detailed explanations to customers about what their DNA says and what it means. So, before you buy, call and talk to their people. Ask them where they are in their product development and how much information you'll actually receive that's tailored to your DNA. THE INFORMATION IS WORTH IT if you can get all of it. It'll be worth the wait if you need to wait.2. UNDERSTAND DNA + TALK WITH YOUR DOCTOR: When I checked my DNA against Promethius, I understood why Vitagene recommended the vitamins they did. Their recommendations were SPOT ON! But this was a double-edged sword. The recommendation came out of potential future/some present health risks coded in my DNA. (Almost like finding out what you might die of). It was hard to read, but super inspiring for someone who has always struggled to eat well. I found myself suddenly motivated! I looked over what Promethius wrote up, made a list of my risks, took it to my doctor and was told that 90% of everyone carries those risks in their DNA (huh...). We're all basically walking around like loaded guns and our lifestyle and diet pull the trigger. The better you understand how your body responds to those things, the better you can avoid that trigger. So, when you get the information from Vitagene, take it to your doctor. Mine looked over the list of vitamin recommendations, affirmed some and cautioned others. She also affirmed my risk list stating that if I feel weird at any given time, we can refer to it and go directly to blood tests instead of guessing for 6-12months and trying again. Super helpful! ...SO while Vitagene didn't get me all the way there, if that's where they're headed, this product is worth your life.The reason I got Vitagene was because I wanted to understand my body better instead of mindlessly eating food and hoping that some form of exercise worked along with some vague idea of what healthy was. I want to do everything I can to not only live long, but live well, and avoid taking drugs for things that a better, DNA-tailored lifestyle can address. This is also Vitagene's goal and an honorable one at that.",0

Evidently no one in my lineage has taken the test to try to connect as I did.  While it gives higher probabilities of connecting back 15 generations or so, that does me no good.

After uploading to Family Tree DNA, by comparison they seem the least accurate and overly generalized if you are hoping to find detailed ethnicity. I paid for My Origins and the results were surprising in a strange way. Much of my family heritage can be traced to west Europe in the region of where France, Switzerland and Germany border each other, yet FT DNA shows 0% in this region. I can only guess that this region was either lumped into British Isles or Eastern European.Another comparison is the British Isles:Family Tree DNA 43%My Heritage 5.6%Ancestry (combining England/Ireland regions) 13%GEDmatch is 24.5% (combining the N. Atlantic and North Sea regions).Being able to trace a branch of my ancestors back to England and Scotland to the 1500's, I'd say Ancestry and GEDmatch (Eurogenes K36) are probably the most accurate. Family Tree DNA seemed to get 3 other regions correct, however two of my big ones were very wrong. Although I did not buy the whole kit on Amazon, only paid for My Origins online I felt I should review here as I find Amazon reviews helpful. If you want to use this kit to find relatives, cousins, etc matching your DNA then Family Tree DNA may be a good choice, but would not recommend them for your ethnicity.",0

Cat got sick!,1,0,"Iâ€™m fairly new to this â€˜cat momâ€™ thing, and of course we all want the best for our fur babies. Being a new mom, I wish I had done significantly more research before buying this food... let me save you the trouble.I bought 3 large bags of the Tender Centers Salmon cat food when it was a really good deal at Target. I was excited to get such a good deal on a well-known â€œreputableâ€� (I thought) brand. I gradually began mixing this food with the previous dry food we had been feeding our two boys (Purina, I think?), and eventually they were solely on this for dry food. They seemed to really enjoy the flavor, and all was well for a month or so...And then our 1 year old male cat began vomiting. Not just once or twice, more like once or twice a week. And then even more frequently... once or twice a DAY. Nothing else in his diet changed. He was and is an overall healthy and playfully active cat. At first I wrote it off in my mind as hairballs. It was quite obviously his shedding season, as he was constantly leaving hair everywhere he went. (Being a new mom, this seemed like a fair conclusion. Cats regularly get hairballs, right?) We began grooming our boy every night, even tried giving him a bath a couple of times in hopes that he would stop vomiting â€˜hairballs,â€™ but to no avail. After another month of vomiting, and a panicked night when we thought he was vomiting blood, we took him to the vet to get some answers.After hearing how we were caring for our cat and what diet changes had recently ensued, our vet strongly recommended disposing of the rest of the Meow Mix cat food. She instead recommended the Hills Science Diet Sensitive Stomach Formula for our cat.I was inclined to do a lot of research before jumping in and spending $40 on a bag of cat food the same size as the Meow Mix which I had purchased for less than $10. What I found out was scary.Many cat foods are made to taste good to the cat and look appealing for humans to feed their pets (I mean really, does a cat understand and think that colorful food is more appealing? I would say probably not... a catâ€™s color vision is similar to a human that is color blind.). Though it may taste good to your cat, it may not provide the nutrition they need. It also can have ingredients that unfortunately are harmful to your pet, such as BHA and BHT as preservatives. As mentioned above, artificial color ingredients (yellow 5, red 40, etc.) have no real benefit and serve only the purpose of adding color. Not to mention, cats by design are carnivores... they need meat! Why, then, are the first two ingredients corn product? Corn is inexpensive and is oftentimes used as filler ingredient in pet food to keep costs down and make it appealing to the consumer on a tight budget.Think of it this way, though... cheap food now probably means expensive vet bills later. Save yourself the time, frustration, and money. Make an investment in higher-quality food for your pet now.To conclude our dilemma, we discovered that the vomit that we thought contained blood ended up being the unnecessary red food coloring in the product. We made the investment (found out in the process that PetSmart matches Amazon pricing, yay!) and our boy is now munching quite happily on the brand recommended by our vet (though in all honesty, after doing my research Iâ€™m inclined to switch to Merrick: Before Grain, as it contains no grain where Hills Science Diet still does contain substantial grain).Giving credit where credit is due, I am so thankful for the research analysts who analyzed 2,443 formulas of cat food in order to help new moms (and dads) like me to make the best decisions for our fur babies. Read their results online and be enlightened. :)",0

I decided to go for it and couldn't be happier.  I upgraded from an MSI R9 390 8G, which is still a very nice card, but was really lagging behind in some games.For example, I had put off playing Assassin's Creed Origins due to poor performance on the R9 390.  I had most of the settings set to low or off and it just didn't make a difference.  After installing the GTX 1080, the game automatically bumped up the settings, and the performance was vastly improved.  Not only did it look like a completely different game, it plays like a completely different game.  This has been the case for all the games I have been testing.  Ghost Recon Wildlands is another example of a massive quality and performance jump.I am new to Nvidia GPU boost, but if my understanding is correct, it will automatically boost as high as possible if power and thermals are in check.  I am currently getting a boost level of 1924 on the Core.  I don't overclock and I have not adjusting any settings to achieve this.  This card so far is a fantastic performer and stays very cool under load.  I have a more aggressive fan curve set in MSI afterburner.I have owned many MSI products over the years and have always felt they have very high quality.  When you remove the card from the packaging, it certainly has some weight and feels very sturdy.  Due to the weight, it's possible you could have to deal with some slight GPU sag.  It's actually lighter than the R9 390 I replaced which was causing sag.  There are several inexpensive ways to alleviate GPU sag.I was in need of a GPU upgrade and was waiting to see what the next Nvidia or AMD gpu is going to be ""possibly"" be later this year.  If and when they even release the first versions they will probably be reference only with inferior performance and cooling.  It can take a good while after that just non-reference cards hit the market.  For me, jumping in now, even though there ""could"" be something arriving in the near future, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.I have been supportive of team Red for many years, but AMD just isn't getting it done at the moment.  I decided that I wanted to improve my gaming experience and Nvidia is the only real option in my opinion.Highly Recommended",0

YOU MAY FALL IN LOVE,5,1,"PROLetâ€™s talk first, this charismatic GPU tends to catch your heart and possibly not let go!! I bought my first GPU mid February, had it shipped 13th of February. Built my first ever gaming PC. I instantly fell in love with this beast that can handle exactly what I needed it to do. Run PUBG. PUBG will run smooth. No problem what so ever. Okay, enough with the talk letâ€™s get started.Equipped with the best cooling for any GPU out there. Running any game glancing over at MSI afterburner I notice my gpu never goes over 85 degrees. That is good. TWIN FRZR you did an amazing performance.Despite the best cooling, it is quiet. Like REALLY quiet. On idle mode, web surfing, this GPU will not make a noise -- thought my life was on mute for a second.Everything that it has to do works with no, ZERO, malfunctions. Runs MSI DRAGON CENTER, MSI MYSTIC LIGHT, and MSI DRAGON EYE all works and do what it needs to do.CONMight be a little bit price overwhelming, but hey, all GPUâ€™s are like that right now arenâ€™t they? Iâ€™d get another one if I neededâ€¦.. or even if I donâ€™t need it I just made a second purchase of the same exact GPU through Amazon, got it delivered 20th. Waiting to have time for myself to do an SLI so I can have two beasts in a case.Going with the first CON, this will make you open your wallet!!!! BECAUSE I AM IN LOVE WITH MSI RIGHT NOW.OTHERAfter purchasing the GPU I would recommend purchasing the MSI Accessory Graphics Card Bolster. To be honest, all GPU slants, or sags. This can be fixed with a holder, or a bracket, but hey couple dollars more and you get an official bracket made especially from a company that manufactures your GPU, so they know what they are dealing with.Also, I am still mad at myself for not finding out or looking into MSI graphics card before doing the whole â€œpurchaseâ€� for my first PC because I did not get an MSI Mother board, instead I chose a different brand, and this is the worst part of my purchase. If I had a second life, or extra cash in my bank, I would definitely purchase an MSI board to go along with my beast. It would be beauty and the beast all in a case.I am writing this review to enter into the MSI Reward Program",0

It is currently running laps around my 980ti and not even breaking a sweat.

In 4k, it shows where the card lacks in horsepower to push everything stable, and in high settings, to +60 fps, but anyway, temperatures are really good, just a couple of times (And Iâ€™ve bought this card on August 2016) going over the 80 C and fan noise is moderate to low, overall, a really good card for 1440p gaming, Iâ€™m very happy with my product and my purchase, 9/10 would buy again (9 just because the software for controlling the LEDâ€™s on the card is BS, but with that aside, is a solid card)",0

Iâ€™m using it currently for my PS4 and Iâ€™m trying to talk to my friends, they can hear me and I can hear them but I canâ€™t hear myself. Also the sound quality is sub par, very heavy bass, no in depth sound quality, maybe thatâ€™s just because the bass is so high with very little treble.

Mic stopped working in less than 30 days & lights are useless.,1,1,"They came to us in perfect condition at first.  The sound and Mic also worked great at first, but in order for the lights to work you have to plug the usb cord into a usb port. In order to do that you can't move around at all because the usb cord is extremely short, so you have to stay right next to where they're plugged in. So our son decided it wasn't worth it, therefore the lights are never on. Uggghh... But the worst part is, after less than a month, the mic no longer works at all! And our son takes VERY good care of his headset. So there's no way any damage came to them in our side. They look perfectly fine but without the mic working, there's no use for this headset. Our sons use headsets to play on their XBOX ONE Live Gold so it's no fun if no one can heard you. Do not buy these! Our other son has a different brand of headset that was even cheaper than these and it's been going strong for over 6 months. And he's 14 & not as careful as or 11 year old, but his headset had held up fine, even after our German Shepherd got a hold of them and chewed the mic a bit. So if that other brand can withstand our dog, and these ones stop working for no reason, then I STRONGLY suggest you buy a different brand. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE! No wonder they offer a protection plan. Instead of wasting my time calling to get a REFURBISHED pair of this garbage headset that will probably take 6-8 weeks to receive, I'm opting for buying a new, different brand of headset. Why use my protection plan for a used pair that doesn't light up and will most likely malfunction quickly and I'll be doing the same thing all over again. Uggghhh!ðŸ˜§ The pics show how the looked first day but how we had to use a cell phone charger to plug the usb in to make the lights work. The split cord is so short & no kid wants to sit in one place while playing Xbox. Our son was really disappointed because he thought the lights were so cool.",0

Setup is fantastic and quick.  It very quickly connected to my Wi-Fi and the Roku setup process was seamless.  I was able to create a Roku account and sign into the apps I already pay for (Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, CBS AA, Sling) and it's up and running.  My only complaint so far is the fact that there is no Ethernet port.  The TV connects to my Internet connection via Wi-Fi, which is great but that does not guarantee a consistent 1080p connection through Wi-Fi.  I will be purchasing a USB/Ethernet connection to plug directly into my modem.The remote is small but functional, I don't see a need for a big remote with a lot of buttons when the TV itself has a fantastic menu.I haven't yet connected any other devices, although there are plenty of connections.

I bought this LG 24"" smart t.v.,- https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01LXHXGZX/ -  and had problems with reception from my antenna (broken and pixelated on a clear, clouless day - other t.v.s in the house w/similar connection had no issues), and with connecting to my wifi network. Returned it, wondering if it was just my sub-standard rural internet connection (which is admittedly not great), and went for this Samsung 24"" smart t.v.. I have other Samsungs that have worked well, and thought it might be worth the extra money. The LG was white, which was nice in my setting, had more convenient remote features than the Samsung. However. the Samsung did connect with my wifi (the LG would find the network, connect, then refuse to load any wifi content), and has better reception of the signal from my antenna. If I lived in town with great wifi, the LG might have been more attractive, but in my rural setting, the Samsung came through with good reception, and a connection that will show streaming content (tried Amazon Prime video). I looked at a Vizio 1080 res, but it was short on connections. I wanted the potential to connect a DVD player in case I swap t.v. locations at a later date. The Samsung had 2 HDMI ports, and audio and video in. Other people complained about this t.v. dropping wifi connection. Will have to see how that goes.

Shipping should've been in descrete package.",4,1,"I was hoping to connect my PC to this TV, but it has no VGA port, unfortunately.Just has two HDMI ports. One of the ports, the ARC one, just happens to be where the vesa wall mount plate goes, and gets blocked by it.There is no VGA port, so you'll need a VGA to HDMI adapter to get an older PC's video to be picked up by the TV.I was disappointed to discover the set won't accept 1280x720, or 1920x720p from a PC.Supported Computer Resolutions:1024 x 768 (XGA), 1280 x 768 (WXGA), 1360 x 768, 640 x 480 (VGA), 800 x 600 (SVGA)There is also no way to connect PC audio directly to the set. That's handled by HDMI.The picture looks fairly even, all across the screen, in terms of brightness.Viewing angle is fairly decent. It is LCD, so, yeh, if you view from too acute an angle, the picture will look a bit dimmer. However, the brightness at acute viewing angles (greater than 45 degrees from center) is much better than most LCD sets I've had.Even high, and low position viewing looks decent.I did notice a wee bit of dimness in the far corners of the screen, but it's tolerable.It aint a CRT. LOL ;)Most LCDs I've had got washed out picture when viewed from very close. This one looks fairly decent, even at close distances.Audio is ""ok"", could be better, if the speakers were forward firing, instead of pointing at the floor. LOL.The set is very light weight, and perfect for mounting on a DJ lighting stand, with the proper vesa plate, and o-clamp attached.It'll be interesting to see how many years this one lasts. The last set I had only ran for 4 years, minimal usage per day, and was not a Sony.Would've been nice, had the set come with mounting screws for the vesa plate, though.The stand leaves a bit to be desired. It felt a bit flimsy, but then the set is very light weight.Would also have been nice if the set came with a coax, and HDMI cables. But then, most factories don't give you your money's worth anymore, anyway. LOL.I was not happy about the seller cheaping out on the shipping. I don't appreciate my purchases being shipped in retail containers. They're not meant for shipping, and don't hold up well to that. It also makes the product vulnerable to porch piracy, and dishonest delivery drivers.I'll update as needed.",0

The item is still popular and I don't want what happened to me to repeat on others. First of all the picture quality is awesome and I am satisfied with it. It has minor problems with zoom and filling in the screen. My complaint is the fact that they have the nerve to claim this to be a smart TV. The apps available is very, very limited. If you only live on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu then perhaps you are good. But this TV has no business claiming a smart TV because it doesn't even have a standard browser. Under tools you can find a URL loader but once you are on a website what do you do? The remote affords no navigation or mouse function at all (unlike the pointer of the LG Smart TV). So it is impossible to use HBO GO app, Showtime, etc. The ""Opera TV"" does not come close to an app store.",0

They are already loud and pretty clear but Smartthings automatically adjust it to your music based on your preferences. The wire-clamp is useless but luckily the wire isn't overly long like some other bluetooth headphones i have had. Changing to the smaller tips they fit perfectly in my ear and there isn't that constant cutting out when i jog. Battery also last pretty long on a charge.I do find it weird that the button in the front when these are on your ears is the button to go to the previous track and the button behind is to go forward, weird choice.If you don't adjust your settings for the buds they will sound very basic i tested them on two phones all week both up-to-date cells and noticed a huge difference. Also be careful with bluetooth 4.0 disconnect from devices you don't want to use if you don't want them switching between devices.In the end anything i was not satisfied with these are completely outweighed by the fact at how inexpensive they are.",110

Who knows?,5,0,"I have the SP4 and I got it at Best Buy bc I don't think buying an item like this on Amazon because you never know when the seller bought the tablet and if you purchased this from Amazon and they purchased this a 6 months ago, you're sol, you'll only have 6 month warranty left on the tablet/laptop. I bought this from Best Buy and the keyboard separately. I also bought the accidental coverage in case I were to drop it and break it within the first year. It was worth it because I could accidentally drop it while putting it in my backpack and I would get a replacement for free.I am typically an Apple fanboy but the 12.9"" iPad Pro did not cut it for the type of work that I do. I bought the 12.9"" iPad Pro for my wife because that's just what she wanted and I could not access my work programs using anything other than IE11 and only Windows uses IE11. Plus, my MB Pro is about 6yrs old and I wanted something that was lighter and a little more portable and updated. Thus the SP4 was purchased. I bought the i5/4GB/128GB version. I wasn't too worries about the speed since the programs I'm using is cloud based minus Adobe but some of the documents are stored in the cloud too. The SP4 just offered me more of what I needed. I miss the Apple integration but I'm gaining a lot more features that I can use for WORK. Now I can work from home and my boss would have no problems with it. I mean, before the SP4 I was using the iPad Mini 4 to track my loans and take notes on it but size really matters. Plus, I can't use my work system on any Apple devices so I had no choice. It was either that or I go into the office everyday rather than going straight to my laptop. I'm on salary anyways so it doesn't mean I have to work 40hrs/week even though I do because I'm not lazy.This is the perfect solution for someone who wants the tablet but also have it function like a laptop. There are too many things that you can't do on an Apple computer than on a Windows device. I will always be an Apple fanboy but for work I need this laptop. I know it's really a tablet but it's a laptop to me because I use it like a laptop and like a laptop it has an USB port, Thunderport, Miscro SD card slot and it also offers you 1TB of cloud storage so having only 128GB of memory didn't bother me at all. Everything is in the cloud these days, I don't even use my USB drive anymore because I can store everything in the cloud and it follows me everywhere I go. I would suggest that you get a full keyboard for this tablet so that you don't lose about half your screen space plus it's a lot easier to type on a keyboard rather than the on screen keyboard. Yes, it costs more but it depends on what you want to do with it. If you want a laptop style tablet and you want all the functionality of a laptop then you will need the keyboard. Plus, it acts like a case and keeps your screen from fingerprints and scratches. Do yourself a favor and get the keyboard. If you don't think you'll need the keyboard then buy an iPad Pro or just an iPad.You won't regret purchasing the keyboard with the tablet. It will be used and it will come in handy, granted it drains your battery but again, it comes down to what you're using the tablet for. Plus you'll like the fact there is a trackpad instead of using your fingers on the screen.",0

I've always played acoustic electric but wanted to try an electric as they have a much broader range of capabilities. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and saw this and knew that Epiphone was well enough worth the price. This thing is impressive, pickups are hopped up for even the $200 regular price. After playing this and hearing it, 200 is still very reasonable. If you are looking for a good starter or something you don't have to worry about watching your every move around that can take some dings and scratches, this is a great option. Nice finish, sounds great, and won't break the bank. Is it a Les Paul?, not at all, it is also not a grand. But it is a great guitar to learn on and see if you enjoy it enough to spend more money on something nicer.

I'm not in a band, I'm not an expert guitarist... I'm just an intermediate-level player, so take what I say with a grain of salt. But this is the best guitar I've tried for $500 or less. I love the coil split on the tuning knob that turns the humbucker bridge pickup into effectively a single-coil (like a strat). It has 22 frets, nicer for a few solos. :)  The tremolo bar (bah, I'm from the 80s, I call it a whammy bar) is fairly standard low-end... nothing great...  EXCEPT be warned that it has an unusual threading on the arm itself, so it may be hard to find a replacement short of contacting Yamaha themselves. I mostly keep mine in storage and rarely use it.

It comes in the basic cardboard box you see in guitar stores with no padding or reinforcement inside the box. Only two strips of packing tape hold the box closed.

It delivers a lot of value, in that it sounds great, and the parts that matter most are solidly crafted. By that I mean the neck and body - this guitar is made out of nice wood, and looks terrific. I can't really judge the quality of the tuning machine or the bridge, since this is the first instrument I've owned, but I was disappointed by the electronics, which seem to me to be dirt cheap. A few week after buying it I started getting horribly painful buzzing and popping sounds every time my body shifted, and when I took the backplate off to inspect the innards, discovered that the output jack was very poorly soldered. I took the extra step of removing the old solder so I could redo it competently. The jack itself is very cheap and flimsy, and I will probably try to replace it with something better at some point. Upon inspecting the rest of the electronic, I'm rather motivated to replace all of them in the coming years, or else buy a higher quality guitar. So I guess my final verdict is, it's a great instrument for beginners on a tight budget, but you get what you pay for. It will look and sound good for the time being, but you may want to brush up on your soldering skills before buying.",4

However, I do recommend to anyone serious about playing a Strat to look into a Fender MIM. This is the closest you'll get to a pro-level guitar, and at a fair price. I went through the same motions as many, thinking ""Can I get by on a decent guitar priced under 300""? Well, I've been a musician my whole life, primarily a saxophone player. The sound is where it's at, period. Second, build quality - how it feels in your hands. Compared to a real Fender, this Pacifica and 'all' Squiers feel like a toy. Sound wise, the Yamaha will do ... but add about 100-200 bucks onto your spending budget and get yourself a Fender, used or new, just make sure it's in good shape and setup correctly. These cheap guitars will hold you back. I am still learning to play guitar, and was shocked at how much better I sound on a Fender MIM. Best of all, I just can't put it down!",1

This was packaged absolutely horribly. Was not secured within the carton (which was barely sealed, opened with the touch of a finger) and was just rocking around inside. Even the delivery driver was concerned. Fortunately it was an overnight delivery, if this had been on the road any longer I'm sure it would have been destroyed by the time it was delivered.

B0002E1OVS,Dean EVO XM Solid Body Electric Guitar - Satin Natural,155.52,2014-02-27T00:00:00Z,"Only my first guitar, but I absolutely love it.",5,1,"Being from Tampa, I wanted my first guitar to be a Dean. Sure, there are plenty of other options out there, but I just had it in my head thats what I wanted. Well, I must say I am very happy with the purchase. Guitar arrived in its triangular shelf box, inside another Dean shipping box, which was wrapped in bubble sheet packed inside yet another, larger, Amazon box. Was essentially ready to play right out of the box, with a few quick turns of the tuning pegs. One knock on it I have seen online before buying was that the tuners don't hold tight, I have not yet had this problem after a week of playing it, including some drastic bends. Checked with a steel straightedge and a light, the neck was dead flat and straight. The edges of the frets could use some more finishing, they are still a bit edgy. I have seen others mention filing them down a bit, same thing that would be done on a more expensive guitar at the factory. I will probably get some diamond files and do this as well, I keep hanging up my hand on them on the bottom of the neck. I'm no expert on tone, but this has a nice even sound and responds well to pretty much any pedals or effects I've thrown at it. I did restring mine with the DR Neon Multi-Color strings for using with Rocksmith, which required adjusting the intonation. The low E and A strings ended up at the very end of their range, and the A is actually still a tiny bit flat. This could well be a factor of those particular strings though, so I wont knock the guitar for it. As others have noted, the finish can vary drastically. Mine is much darker than the stock photo and the grain is much less noticeable. Overall, looks a nice piece, especially for the cost. I could not ask for better for this price. From what I hear from more experienced players, as I progress I could easily upgrade the tuners and pickups, though I think I will leave this one alone and just get a higher end guitar when its time.",1

B0002E1OVS,Dean EVO XM Solid Body Electric Guitar - Satin Natural,155.52,2017-11-06T00:00:00Z,Solid but not ideal,3,1,"Almost 3 years ago i bought this guitar to start off my guitar players journey. Did I expect to stick with it? No, but thankfully I did, and I would encourage any aspiring musicians to do the same. After all, the first month is the hardest. Did this instrument attribute to me deciding to stick with guitar? Honestly I think so, I was a beginner back then and I did not know much about quality vs price in these instruments so I picked my favorite looking guitar I could find in my price range. It doesn't sound great, it doesn't stay in tune, and it doesn't feel great to play. But for this price can I really complain? I don't think so. For me what kept me coming back was looking at its Les Paul style design and visioning myself playing along with Slash or Page on the big stages with a full blown Gibson. This leads me to my main point which is at this price range whatever you get will suck so i suggest you buy a guitar based on the type of guitar you hope to one day play. If you dont know what you want to play think of your favorite artists, Pink Floyd fans for instance will want to go for a Squier Strat and Guns N' Roses fans like myself might find an Epiphone Les Paul most enjoyable. Now that Iv rambled on for a few minutes and havent really gotten anywhere I'll just leave you with one more bit of advice. If your certain you cant spend any more than $200 on a guitar go for the big companies like Fender (Fenders Squier range) and Epiphone, and go for the guitar that you think will get you picking up the guitar again, because at the end of the day it doesn't matter how good your guitar sounds and feels if you just don't like it.",1

B00EDSCTO0,Jackson JS22 Dinky - Metallic Blue,199.99,2016-09-13T00:00:00Z,Incredible guitar with some slight adjustments.,5,0,"So I was skeptical about this guitar, 200 bucks is pretty cheap. I promise this is worth every penny and more...with a little work. I've been playing guitar, specifically for metal, for 19 years and have had owned over 20 guitars in my lifetime. I've had other Jacksons, Ibanez, B.C. Rich, Schecter, Fender, Epiphone, Gibson, and more. This is every bit as good as the $1000+ plus guitars I have owned in every way. Here's what you can do out of the box to make this a throat slashing metal machine. First off, TIGHTEN THE TUNING MACHINES! They were definitely loose on mine and the guitar was coming out of tune very quickly. After tightening them, the guitar stays in tune for weeks at a time. There was some minor fret buzz on the high E, I found the fret giving me trouble, I used a luthiers file and ever so slightly trimmed the height of the fret bar. Problem solved. The action right out of the box was perfect for me, I like it close. I know have an excellent guitar that I could not be happier with. If you want the Floyd Rose, pay the extra $100 and get the same model with that. I personally despise the Floyd Rose, so this model is for me. I find that the pickups are pretty hot and I  didn't need to replace them.",2

B075RH1G7D,"Premium Weighted Blanket, Perfect Size and Weight (12lb) For Adults...",199,2018-04-06T00:00:00Z,Sooo soft and yes.....calming!!,5,1,"I purchased this blanket a couple of weeks ago.  I must say, this is the best blanket I've ever purchased for my bed!  I purchased the gray only because I have a feeling my kids might want to take it on me!!!  If they do - I'll definitely be buying another.  I was apprehensive at first because I didn't understand how a blanket could calm people.  Well - my mistake.  I guess they're out there!  I do not sleep well at all.  I toss and turn most of the night.  God forbid I get up to go to the bathroom, I'm up for at least an hour before I can fall back asleep again.  Although not diagnosed, I know I have anxiety issues and the possibility of depression.  Thoughts go through my head about anything and everything.  Sometimes I find myself even making up stories in my head.  I just cannot turn the thoughts off when I go to bed.  It drives me absolutely nuts because I am so tired when I wake up.  I figured, what the heck - I'll try this blanket out.First off, I don't understand why people complain and give it less marks because it's warm.  Of course it's warm!!!  It's a weighted 12lb blanket - what do people expect?  Where less to bed or get a fan, buy it's no excuse to take marks off.  I am starting to suffer from hot flashes and quite honestly, although I still get them at night, not as much with this blanket.  Maybe my other comforter is made of another material that doesn't breathe as good, I don't know.  I was afraid to try this blanket because of my hot flashes but I just didn't care anymore, I wanted to try something.This blanket is so soft!!  The 12lb weight is perfect and I'm sure if it was heavier, it would be fine for me.  I can always just fold it in 1/2 for double the weight but I have not done that yet.  I have a king size bed so it does not fit.  But I don't care.  It would definitely fit a full and possibly a queen, but not a king.  Again - I don't care.  The first night I used this blanket I slept like a baby.  Then the next night - same thing.  Granted, this blanket is not a miracle blanket.....I still have thoughts going in my head at night, but no where near as much.  If I get up to go to the bathroom - I fall back asleep probably in about 10/15 minutes or so.  Much better than before.  We went away for a few nights.  Again - here come all of those thoughts again racing through my head....what we did that day, plans for the next day, what I should've done, what's the weather going to be like, etc.  Came home exhausted from little sleep.  Went to bed with my new blanket - fell asleep pretty quick and got much needed sleep.  That proved to me that this blanket does help people with anxiety issues.  Again - it's no miracle worker - but for me personally - it really helps out a lot.  If they weren't so expensive, I'd probably buy a few more but for the time being - this blanket is all mine - that is....until my kids find out about it!  lolOh....and yes - there are ties inside to keep everything in place.  There is a tie in all 4 corners and a tie in the middle.  There's supposed to be a loop on both sides but mine was missing one.  So, instead of having 8 loops/ties....mine has 8 ties with only 7 loops.  The zipper is approximately 15"" long.  I did not measure.  Blanket is super soft - solid on one side and texture on the other side.  I have not tried washing it yet so I cannot comment on that.If one can afford it, I would highly suggest giving this blanket a try if you suffer from anxiety issues.  If it can calm someone like myself, I'm sure it can work wonders for other people!!!!",0

His difficulties getting to sleep had escalated and I was hoping this would help him get to sleep more easily.  He has really enjoyed the blanket so far, and while not a miracle cure, his struggle getting to sleep has been greatly reduced.

The feel and texture are amazing, so cuddly and soft and keeps you incredibly warm ( yea I know I said it was for my son but of course I had to try it out). My son for the first time in forever (it seems) sleep in his own bed, all through the night...it's amazing.Only thing, as much as I love the outter covering of the blanket (the soft fuzzy velour), I do wonder how it will be in the summer - I may have to get a lighter cover.

I sleep with it folded in half, I'm 5'2 and with it doubled up, it's still big enough to cover me. It helps relax me by taking all of the tension out of my body, something about the weight just helps so much.  So 200 dollars may seem like a lot, but investing in good sleep is absolutely worth it.

Its not a whole bed size and is more for an individual.  The way the internal weighted blanket is made, it doesn't seem to suffer from shifting of the weight (piling up in one side or another).  The weight is sown into individual chambers to prevent this.

The cover keeps the blanket in place, is a very nice color, and that very plush polysterish stuff.  You can always use it with a regular duvet cover but you do want the corners connected securely, otherwise you'll go nuts trying to straighten it out not least because it is heavy.

Grown up and raised in Hawaii, many of us use a futon from childhood to adult as a blanket.  Not as a mattress.  My futon weighs around 10 lbs. and I figured that maybe there was some validity to this 10% of your body weight formula.  Not true.

Even when using the blanket during the day when I am on the couch it still reduces my anxiety by draping it over my shoulders. I would highly recommend, it is worth the price.Note: I have a full bed and the blanket fits perfectly over it. I measured it and it is 58â€�x77â€�.

I was afraid I'd get too hot since I get warm pretty easily, but not with this. Its a thick fabric with what reminds me of beanie baby beads in it. The fabric while thick, actually keeps me cool! The reason I bought this blanket was because of my severe anxiety. I wake up out of intense dreams and a pounding heart on a nightly basis.

My wife and I have had some rough nights with our child who has ADHD.  Prior to the weighted blanket he couldnâ€™t turn his mind off and fall asleep and when he did it was inconsistent at best.  We tried so many different things from essential oils to melatonin.  This was the 1st thing that really worked.  It helped calm him down and allows him to get a good night sleep. I have noticed that since he has been using it he falls into a deeper more restful sleep.  I did a ton of research before I bought this blanket, this is by far the best blanket that combines both quality and cost effectiveness.

Bought one for my husband he kind of turned his nose up at it at first but he doesn't sleep without it now. The weight of the blanket was perfect.  Before using the blanket he would flop around the bed like a fish out of water. Not anymore....  so not only is he getting a better sleep so am I. My son came home from college and fell in love with the blanket. I surprised him and  bought one for him too.  He so wanted to take it back to the dorm for the last 2 weeks he had left but it stayed behind.

The sound is clear and they cancel noise fairly well without having to turn up the volume very loud. The quality of the sound is great if not a tiny bit muffled and there's a lot of focus on the mid to high range which I love because I'm not a huge fan of a lot of bass. The only reason I am giving these headphones 4 out of 5 stars is because they are uncomfortable after about an hour of use. I have a small head and wear glasses and these headphones rely on pressure to keep themselves in place which makes them uncomfortable if you wear them for long periods of time.,0

I'm a huge Bowers & Wilkins fan as an owner of their speakers so I started with the P5 wireless and while sounding great they didn't fit my head well and I could hear outside sounds fairly easy, I liked the sound but the fit was a no go. Then I decided to step up to the P7 wireless which fit fantatic and are just a beautiful headphone. My issue with the P7 wireless was the base was just to heavy and on some tracks overpowered the mids and vocals which didn't fit my taste. I was disappointed because I really loved the feel and fit of them and they are a beautiful headphone but unfortunately it was  0 - 2 for Bowers & Wilkins headphones.",0

B01MSZSL4I,Sennheiser HD 4.50 Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Active Noise...,179.93,2018-04-20T00:00:00Z,Pros far outweigh the cons,4,1,"So as a whole the headphones are really nice.  Comfortable to a point, as with all headphones that I use after so long my ears/head just can't take it anymore.  I'm perfectly satisfied that this could be an issue with my big a** head.  With that said they are still very comfortable, very cushiony actually. These are probably the easiest headphones to pair up, with past headphones pairing mode always had to be activated outside of turning the power on. There is no pairing mode for these, you turn it on and if it doesn't connect to anything it activates pairing mode, it's as seamless as you could want.  Though, the next easiest way is by NFC, which is installed in the left earcup, just turn on NFC on your phone, touch the ear cup and it connects.  About as easy as it gets, couldn't have asked for a better way to pair devices.  The noise cancelling works pretty darn good, it's not perfect, there's been a couple of static frequencies that it couldn't drown out but i only noticed it when i either paused the music or in between songs.  Now that I've talked about the good things i'll touch on the bad ones. I can only find a few of them which is a good thing in my mind.  So i know a different review touched on this aspect so I think I should as well, just to show some continuity on the matter.  So the company says these are over the ear headphones, that's a bit of a technicality.  They technically are over the ear, but the area that's supposed to go around the ear isn't very big so unless you have small ears part of the cushion will be resting on your ears.  If you have big ears, sort of like myself, there is a way to, as you put them on, to fold your ears into the hole without it being uncomfortable.  Another negative is the headphone cord, now it's not necessarily the cord, the jack that's on the earcup isn't the best design so you can easily not plug it in all the way.  Though you will know when you don't because, while the sound comes in on both speakers, it sounds like you've hit the ""concert hall"" theme on the equalizer so it's very echoey.  Once you plug it in correctly it's hard to tell the difference in sound between the headphone jack and the bluetooth.  The last negative is the ""multi-function"" button on the earcup, it's got more functionality than most headphones, though half of those functions will only work with their proprietary music player.  Only the general functions will work across devices.The proprietary player is really nice looking i just wish it would be able to interact with other source audios.  As an example itunes or google music, i already pay a subscription fee for music I'm not going to cancel one that works very well for a different one that only works really well with one set of headphones.",0

First, let me say they were easy to pair with my Kindle.  I got these to use at home, but I wouldn't like them if I needed to travel with them since they do not fold.  I think the sound is good, although not exceptional.  I don't think these are considered noise cancelling headphones, which my regular headphones are.  I do prefer the noise cancelling feature in headphones although it may cost a little more.  I have several Panasonic products and have always found them to be reliable products.",0

They are comfortable enough to wear during a TV binging session, but probably not ideal in terms of comfort if you plan to wear them all day every day. They connect and reconnect to Android and Windows 10 without problems. Charging is simple, using the included charging cable, they take about as much time as the manual says.

They are also lightweight, extremely comfortable and easy to adjust to different head sizes, thanks to a simple design that allows you to adjust the width by sliding the earphones along a metal track.  The Bluetooth technology works well, and they are easy to charge and connect.  The headphones have an attractive retro look about them, though this might not be a selling point for the younger generation, which seems to crave black headphones.  They also don't have the noise canceling quality of other headphones, and the sound is audible by those nearby at higher volumes.  If you're looking for a comfortable and serviceable set of over-the-ear headphones, however, this Panasonic product offers a good value for your money.",0

I tested the sound against another ""retro"" styled headphone, the Grado Labs SR 80e studio headphones. For sure, the Panasonics don't have the same clarity in the high end and low end, but all the sound samples I listened to were pleasing, and I could hear all the instruments: in jazz, drum and bass, and speaking / interview. So, decent sound quality, even if it were wired. But wireless, it's awesome. It's the fourth Bluetooth set I've tried, and it's the only one that doesn't suck. :-)",0

They connect via bluetooth and in both cases I was able to get connected and start using them immediately (I've had varied success with other bluetooth devices). Once I got them connected I was pleasantly surprised that the audio quality was pretty darn good. I listened to some of my favorite songs via streaming and I got good quality across all levels. I also watched a couple of movies and was similarly impressed. Probably the only knock I have is the volume level is not all that loud which I could compensate a little bit with the volume on the phone laptop. This isn't a big deal to me because I don't like it to be ear bleeding loud anyway. Overall, very good headphones.",0

I love being able to listen to music or audiobooks while I'm working without bothering anyone else. The problem has been one of comfort and, to some extent, durability.

I have a big head and sometimes have trouble finding headphones that wrap comfortably.  These do with room to spare.  The cups are soft and the set is really lightweight, so high marks for comfort.  The sound is just acceptable though.  Not great.  Iâ€™ve had trouble with the connection momentarily dropping too.  It cuts out for half a second at least once every 10 minutes.

The 24 hour battery life was a big eye opener as well. But sadly they just do not stand up to all that they say they do. I can only get them to connect to either my phone or my husbands - but you have to completely delete the saved bluetooth connection in order to get them to connect to another device. I have gone back and fourth with panasonic via phone and live chat about this and they just told me over and over to remove the connection on the phone to pair to another device. That makes no sense to me at all - why take the time to set up and pair the device to my phone so I can use them when I am doing whatever and then another day my husband wants to use them with his phone when working and I have to unpair it on my phone so he can pair with his phone.,0

In fact until recently I only used this stuff as an additive to heat up other more flavorful sauces. Now that there are lots of sauces that are both several-times hotter and have much better flavor, I doubt I'll be revisiting this sauce any time soon.

My dad tried a spoonful of it while he was working up in Alaska. Big mistake. He couldn't breathe. It nearly sent him to the hospital. I was smart enough to put some on a spoon and then dip the tip of my tongue into it, not try and eat a whole spoonful. This sauce is extremely thick and concentrated. It barely runs out of the bottle without some shaking for encouragement. It has a very bitter pepper extract flavor up-front, with a touch of smoky habanero. If you can get over the nasty bitterness, you might even be encouraged to try some more. Don't. Then, the burn hits. After tasting just a little of this, you will need milk. Like, five glasses of milk. And it's oily and the milk just spreads it around your mouth and makes the burn worse, at first. If you like spicing up your food, this is very economical; a teaspoon will make any dish almost inedibly hot for most people. One bottle will last a very, very long time. Don't be dismayed by the gross flavor; when diluted in a bowl of chili con carne, the bitterness vanishes.",0

I am a big fan of hot sauces and occasionally I get some to where I'm feeling the heat, and it's almost uncomfortable.  Sometimes.

I was pretty excited for a new hot sauce.  You know, whatever.  But I decided to take a quick break at work and pour some on a flour tortilla and try it out.So I put a nice LINE of it down...like a shoelace.  The equivalent to maybe 40 or 50 drops.MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!!The funny thing was that I got a very important conference call just a minute after this happened.I tried honey packets, water, clenching my fists, biting my fist, swearing to myself.So I would call it hot no problem.Aside from the heat, I think it tastes a little weird.I have had this for about eight months and the bottle is still 90% full.One drop at a time, people.",0

The taste leans more towards a strong smokey flavor rather than the expected ""chili"" flavor.  The heat of this product hits you about 3 minutes after ingestion so there's quite the delay in spiciness.  After sampling a small amount, and gaining the courage to try one solid drop, I accidentally dropped 3 nickel-sized drops on a chip.  Thinking I could move past it easily I went ahead and ate the chip.  Fast forward 10 minutes and I was bent over the porcelain throne, while my girlfriend was calling an ambulance.  I blacked out and came to, with two paramedics kneeling over me performing the necessary procedures to stabilize me.  I temporarily lost the vision in my right eye for about 15 minutes until the medicine they gave me revived my vision.  I showed them the product and they informed me that ingesting spicy sauces like this one can cause permanent damage to organs and shut them down temporarily as was the case in my situation.  1 star for this product because it definitely delivered on heat but is definitely a health hazard and ""at-your-own-risk"" as it says on the bottle.",0

They are light weight, which I was looking for, and hold the guy lines for my tent securely, but allow for easy removal.  The stakes tend to bend fairly easily.  The ground was not rocky or very hard at all.  Any lateral pressure causes them to bend.  Even when bent, they still held securely, but the bent stakes were basically useless when we left.

",48.76,2018-04-27T00:00:00Z,So far so good!!!  Still rating this tent.,4,1,"My tent just arrived yesterday. I struggled on what to give this tent for a rating because I just got it.  I was thinking about giving it a 3 for average which seemed fair to start with.  But after seeing how it handled the wind without breaking or tearing, I decided to give it a 4 because it surpassed my expectations.  I plan on using this tent quite a bit this summer so I will update my rating and review as I go.  I found the assembly instructions to be very basic but adequate.  Anyone who has put up a tent like this before will have no problem.  It took me about 15 minutes.  Anyway, I set my tent up in my back yard yesterday to see how it looked and how it took on the elements.  My first test was wind.  I have a weather station and the average wind speed was 7 to 8 mph with gusts up to 17 mph.  The back of the tent was torward the wind and when the gusts would come, the back of the tent would bow it quite a bit.  I have read the reviews some people have written and see some have had problems with the poles breaking.  This is what I was afraid of as I watched the back of the tent bow in.  I wish I had taken a picture because it was substantial.  Anyway, the poles did not break and the tent returned to itâ€™s original form when the gust passed every time.  I have seen the video on Amazon of the testing process Coleman puts their tents through.  Not sure how much wind this tent is rated for but Iâ€™m pretty sure 17 mph is close to itâ€™s max.  The tent looks to be made very well for the price I paid for it.  There are only two guidelines that come off the rain fly on the sides of the tent.  The tent is staked down on all four corners of the floor plus a floor vent in the back of the tent.  In all, there are only 7 stake down points that I could see. I feel if the tent had some guidelines higher up on each of the four corners of the main body of the tent it could withstand more wind.  The stakes are ok but bend fairly easily if the ground is too hard or you hit a rock when pounding them in.  I will be buying some better ones before I go camping.  I left the tent up over night and checked on it this morning.  It held up very well and only one of the stakes for the rain fly guidelines had twisted in the ground causing the guideline to come loose.  I left the tent up because it was going to rain today.  I need to know if I have any leaks before I take it out camping.  It has been raining lightly for two hours now and my weather station says Iâ€™m getting .05 inches of rain an hour with a light steady wind of 2 to 3 mph.  Far from what I would consider a hard rain but itâ€™s still rain.  I went out and looked at just the outside and the water seems to be beading up and running off the rain fly and tent very well.  It is supposed to rain until 9 or 10 oâ€™clock tonight so I will check for water on the inside in the morning.  Iâ€™m hoping not to see any with such a light rain.  If there is, I will definitely be spraying the tent down with a waterproofing spray before I take it out camping.  Now for the proâ€™s and conâ€™s.Proâ€™s:1). Great tent for the price.  If your on a fixed budget or are looking for a good starter tent you will not beat this one.2). Very roomy inside.  I plan on using this for two people, a shepherd and, all our gear.3)  There is an eyelet at the top of the tent so you can attach a lantern and two side pockets for stowing smaller needed items like a headlamp, cell phone, keys and, so on.4). There is a small zipper in the bottom front left side of the tent for running wires.  See my picture.  It is covered by a little yellow strip of material to protect the zipper from the rain.  You do not see this feature on most tents.  I plan on using it with my solar panel so I can charge my power core, headlamp, cell phone and, other gear from inside the tent out of direct sunlight.5). I was surprised at how much give the tent had at 17 mph gusts and did not break any poles or tear. It bounced right back to itâ€™s original form.Conâ€™s:1). You may want to consider buying stronger tent stakes.2). I wish there was a high point on each of the four corners for attaching extra guidelines.  Although it handled 17 mph gusts very well the tent did bow in quite a bit.  If I had to guess, the tent was reduce by almost half itâ€™s size. If I was inside the tent I know I would have been annoyed being hit by it every time a gust came. I really donâ€™t feel the tent as is, could handle much more then that.  Iâ€™m thinking about how to attach extra guidelines in the corners without effecting the structural stability and elasticity of the tent.  Make sure you pitch this tent in a sheltered area out of the wind if your expecting bad weather.That is all for now and there will be more updates coming.",0

Luckily so far I have always had a hand to set it up. I have taken it out camping a dozen or so times and have always had a little trouble with wind. Even tying everything down the piles would still collapse in the wind. This past weekend I took it out again. It was very windy and I set it up and even cracked the windows a bit to let the wind through. This time however it did not just collapse the poles broke. I live how spacious the tent is and the room in the front is perfect. It is super high in the main area so no problem standing up but the set up and the wind issues mean that I am now looking for a new tent.,0

Tent tested and approved by a camping pro video proof.",5,1,"Â We are huge amazon shoppers for many years and never wrote a review. With this product We decided to do a review months after we used it. We went on a 10 day camping trip through northern Michigan with our 2 and 4 year olds. This was our first trip for the kids and the wife. I actually teach outdoor education, survival skills, team building, and everything that comes with it for over 15 years and countless experience prior. All I need in the woods is about 5 items and I would do just fine for quite some time. My wife and kids on the other hand need much, much, much more. So we planned this trip pretty hard core and invested in a ton of things that most would not -the main thing was a portable potty and a tent for that- and of course a tent. We picked this tent after searching and searching for what would work best for our family.We traveled from spot to spot only spending a few days at a time in locations and covered some miles. This tent saw the dunes, rugged campsites, perfect campsite, grass, sand, dirt, mud, rain, thunderstorms, flooding, you name it. It held strong. The kids were happy and most important the wife was happy. This was her very first camping trip and she loved it. This is something i was worried about and i went to great lengths to make this a perfect trip so we can do this over and over again. Camping is a dying art and i grew up camping and in my mind mastered it. So it was a win for our family and me.We waterproofed this tent with a spray. We made sure the fly was perfect and this thing was staked down properly each time. This is very very important. It takes time to get that right with a new tent but history has taught me a ton. I have read reviews and most of the bad ones i can tell you right now are people that had no clue what they were doing and did not put in the time to master the most important tool of a camping trip. The tent. We spent hours mastering this tent before we even hit the road. HOURS. When you pull up to set up you best have a plan and know your tent. If you dont then im sure you will take it out by writing a bad review and making guys like me laugh. Thanks for that. Put in the time.I am attaching a video of our biggest challenge on our massive adventure. We were in the middle of nowhere on our 6th day when the mother of all thunderstorms and flood maker arrived at our campsite. It kinda takes a lot for me to worry in any situation. I worried for about 2 min and knew we were good. Being confident in your tent when you are hours from a hotel is a great feeling. I can say this about this tent. My wife and kids hearts were pounding and they were straight up scared while I was loving the thrill. Once everyone knew we were not going to float away and our tent was water tight it turned out to be pretty fun and a heart pounding memory we all will keep forever. Put in the time, dont let camping become a dying art, and oh ya....PUT IN THE TIME. Your wife will thank you later....",0

They are light weight, which I was looking for, and hold the guy lines for my tent securely, but allow for easy removal.  The stakes tend to bend fairly easily.  The ground was not rocky or very hard at all.  Any lateral pressure causes them to bend.  Even when bent, they still held securely, but the bent stakes were basically useless when we left.  Despite the bending, I would still buy them again.",0

I did put on a pair of gloves, and tried to bend one of these, with no success.You may want to consider having shorter stakes too, if you are going into an area of hard ground, as these are 9 inches long, and might be a tripping hazard.

We had a queen-size air mattress inside and it basically took up the entire space with some room to spare for our gear. Good ventilation. We used it in the spring time, so it was warm enough for cool weather (mid50's-mid60's) and under some shade breezy enough for warmer weather (mid-70's). I would recommend.

",48.76,2018-04-27T00:00:00Z,So far so good!!!  Still rating this tent.,4,1,"My tent just arrived yesterday. I struggled on what to give this tent for a rating because I just got it.  I was thinking about giving it a 3 for average which seemed fair to start with.  But after seeing how it handled the wind without breaking or tearing, I decided to give it a 4 because it surpassed my expectations.  I plan on using this tent quite a bit this summer so I will update my rating and review as I go.  I found the assembly instructions to be very basic but adequate.  Anyone who has put up a tent like this before will have no problem.  It took me about 15 minutes.  Anyway, I set my tent up in my back yard yesterday to see how it looked and how it took on the elements.  My first test was wind.  I have a weather station and the average wind speed was 7 to 8 mph with gusts up to 17 mph.  The back of the tent was torward the wind and when the gusts would come, the back of the tent would bow it quite a bit.  I have read the reviews some people have written and see some have had problems with the poles breaking.  This is what I was afraid of as I watched the back of the tent bow in.  I wish I had taken a picture because it was substantial.  Anyway, the poles did not break and the tent returned to itâ€™s original form when the gust passed every time.  I have seen the video on Amazon of the testing process Coleman puts their tents through.  Not sure how much wind this tent is rated for but Iâ€™m pretty sure 17 mph is close to itâ€™s max.  The tent looks to be made very well for the price I paid for it.  There are only two guidelines that come off the rain fly on the sides of the tent.  The tent is staked down on all four corners of the floor plus a floor vent in the back of the tent.  In all, there are only 7 stake down points that I could see. I feel if the tent had some guidelines higher up on each of the four corners of the main body of the tent it could withstand more wind.  The stakes are ok but bend fairly easily if the ground is too hard or you hit a rock when pounding them in.  I will be buying some better ones before I go camping.  I left the tent up over night and checked on it this morning.  It held up very well and only one of the stakes for the rain fly guidelines had twisted in the ground causing the guideline to come loose.  I left the tent up because it was going to rain today.  I need to know if I have any leaks before I take it out camping.  It has been raining lightly for two hours now and my weather station says Iâ€™m getting .05 inches of rain an hour with a light steady wind of 2 to 3 mph.  Far from what I would consider a hard rain but itâ€™s still rain.  I went out and looked at just the outside and the water seems to be beading up and running off the rain fly and tent very well.  It is supposed to rain until 9 or 10 oâ€™clock tonight so I will check for water on the inside in the morning.  Iâ€™m hoping not to see any with such a light rain.  If there is, I will definitely be spraying the tent down with a waterproofing spray before I take it out camping.  Now for the proâ€™s and conâ€™s.Proâ€™s:1). Great tent for the price.  If your on a fixed budget or are looking for a good starter tent you will not beat this one.2). Very roomy inside.  I plan on using this for two people, a shepherd and, all our gear.3)  There is an eyelet at the top of the tent so you can attach a lantern and two side pockets for stowing smaller needed items like a headlamp, cell phone, keys and, so on.4). There is a small zipper in the bottom front left side of the tent for running wires.  See my picture.  It is covered by a little yellow strip of material to protect the zipper from the rain.  You do not see this feature on most tents.  I plan on using it with my solar panel so I can charge my power core, headlamp, cell phone and, other gear from inside the tent out of direct sunlight.5). I was surprised at how much give the tent had at 17 mph gusts and did not break any poles or tear. It bounced right back to itâ€™s original form.Conâ€™s:1). You may want to consider buying stronger tent stakes.2). I wish there was a high point on each of the four corners for attaching extra guidelines.  Although it handled 17 mph gusts very well the tent did bow in quite a bit.  If I had to guess, the tent was reduce by almost half itâ€™s size. If I was inside the tent I know I would have been annoyed being hit by it every time a gust came. I really donâ€™t feel the tent as is, could handle much more then that.  Iâ€™m thinking about how to attach extra guidelines in the corners without effecting the structural stability and elasticity of the tent.  Make sure you pitch this tent in a sheltered area out of the wind if your expecting bad weather.That is all for now and there will be more updates coming.",0

Luckily so far I have always had a hand to set it up. I have taken it out camping a dozen or so times and have always had a little trouble with wind. Even tying everything down the piles would still collapse in the wind. This past weekend I took it out again. It was very windy and I set it up and even cracked the windows a bit to let the wind through. This time however it did not just collapse the poles broke. I live how spacious the tent is and the room in the front is perfect. It is super high in the main area so no problem standing up but the set up and the wind issues mean that I am now looking for a new tent.,0

We had water come through the bottom seams and all of the window seams.

Tent tested and approved by a camping pro video proof.",5,1,"Â We are huge amazon shoppers for many years and never wrote a review. With this product We decided to do a review months after we used it. We went on a 10 day camping trip through northern Michigan with our 2 and 4 year olds. This was our first trip for the kids and the wife. I actually teach outdoor education, survival skills, team building, and everything that comes with it for over 15 years and countless experience prior. All I need in the woods is about 5 items and I would do just fine for quite some time. My wife and kids on the other hand need much, much, much more. So we planned this trip pretty hard core and invested in a ton of things that most would not -the main thing was a portable potty and a tent for that- and of course a tent. We picked this tent after searching and searching for what would work best for our family.We traveled from spot to spot only spending a few days at a time in locations and covered some miles. This tent saw the dunes, rugged campsites, perfect campsite, grass, sand, dirt, mud, rain, thunderstorms, flooding, you name it. It held strong. The kids were happy and most important the wife was happy. This was her very first camping trip and she loved it. This is something i was worried about and i went to great lengths to make this a perfect trip so we can do this over and over again. Camping is a dying art and i grew up camping and in my mind mastered it. So it was a win for our family and me.We waterproofed this tent with a spray. We made sure the fly was perfect and this thing was staked down properly each time. This is very very important. It takes time to get that right with a new tent but history has taught me a ton. I have read reviews and most of the bad ones i can tell you right now are people that had no clue what they were doing and did not put in the time to master the most important tool of a camping trip. The tent. We spent hours mastering this tent before we even hit the road. HOURS. When you pull up to set up you best have a plan and know your tent. If you dont then im sure you will take it out by writing a bad review and making guys like me laugh. Thanks for that. Put in the time.I am attaching a video of our biggest challenge on our massive adventure. We were in the middle of nowhere on our 6th day when the mother of all thunderstorms and flood maker arrived at our campsite. It kinda takes a lot for me to worry in any situation. I worried for about 2 min and knew we were good. Being confident in your tent when you are hours from a hotel is a great feeling. I can say this about this tent. My wife and kids hearts were pounding and they were straight up scared while I was loving the thrill. Once everyone knew we were not going to float away and our tent was water tight it turned out to be pretty fun and a heart pounding memory we all will keep forever. Put in the time, dont let camping become a dying art, and oh ya....PUT IN THE TIME. Your wife will thank you later....",0

B0000DID5R,Dave's Original Insanity Hot Sauce - 5oz,8.29,2017-08-05T00:00:00Z,Exactly what it says on the package - Insanity,5,0,"Extremely hot! This sauce is no joke. My dad tried a spoonful of it while he was working up in Alaska. Big mistake. He couldn't breathe. It nearly sent him to the hospital. I was smart enough to put some on a spoon and then dip the tip of my tongue into it, not try and eat a whole spoonful. This sauce is extremely thick and concentrated. It barely runs out of the bottle without some shaking for encouragement. It has a very bitter pepper extract flavor up-front, with a touch of smoky habanero. If you can get over the nasty bitterness, you might even be encouraged to try some more. Don't. Then, the burn hits. After tasting just a little of this, you will need milk. Like, five glasses of milk. And it's oily and the milk just spreads it around your mouth and makes the burn worse, at first. If you like spicing up your food, this is very economical; a teaspoon will make any dish almost inedibly hot for most people. One bottle will last a very, very long time. Don't be dismayed by the gross flavor; when diluted in a bowl of chili con carne, the bitterness vanishes.",0

As we call it in the law enforcement community. I have been pepper sprayed as part of my police training and found that this sauce has a very similar flavor to that Sabre Red. Its like a strong dried red cayenne pepper flavor. To conclude, i will say that this sauce is not for a beginner or average consumer, i call it ""medium"" heat, but I'm a chili head and like that kind of pain.",0

This is indeed HOT, but eating it neat doesn't feel quite as intense as eating a fresh habanero to me- my ears were not burning.  The heat is quick to start, strong, and tingly, lasting for several minutes.  The flavor of the sauce reminds me a little of tomato paste with cherries (but not sweet) and I don't really taste chili peppers.  Excellent for kicking things up without altering flavor too much.

Batches do vary from what I've noticed, some are spicier or more favorable. It's spice level is up there. This is a good entry level to the kingdom of HOT sauce. Make sure to work your way up.

I was pretty excited for a new hot sauce.  You know, whatever.  But I decided to take a quick break at work and pour some on a flour tortilla and try it out.So I put a nice LINE of it down...like a shoelace.  The equivalent to maybe 40 or 50 drops.MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!!The funny thing was that I got a very important conference call just a minute after this happened.I tried honey packets, water, clenching my fists, biting my fist, swearing to myself.So I would call it hot no problem.Aside from the heat, I think it tastes a little weird.I have had this for about eight months and the bottle is still 90% full.One drop at a time, people.",0

The taste leans more towards a strong smokey flavor rather than the expected ""chili"" flavor.  The heat of this product hits you about 3 minutes after ingestion so there's quite the delay in spiciness.  After sampling a small amount, and gaining the courage to try one solid drop, I accidentally dropped 3 nickel-sized drops on a chip.  Thinking I could move past it easily I went ahead and ate the chip.  Fast forward 10 minutes and I was bent over the porcelain throne, while my girlfriend was calling an ambulance.  I blacked out and came to, with two paramedics kneeling over me performing the necessary procedures to stabilize me.  I temporarily lost the vision in my right eye for about 15 minutes until the medicine they gave me revived my vision.  I showed them the product and they informed me that ingesting spicy sauces like this one can cause permanent damage to organs and shut them down temporarily as was the case in my situation.  1 star for this product because it definitely delivered on heat but is definitely a health hazard and ""at-your-own-risk"" as it says on the bottle.",0

As it is tomato based, it is more similar to the ""Mexican Ketchups"" I've had in Europe then a traditional vinegar or chili forward hot sauce. The flavors are subtle or muddied (depending on your disposition) which allows it to accompany a wider variety of foods without being overpowering. However, that also means it lacks a bit of the punch and perk of more straight forward sauces.For my own taste this sauce is a bit too indistinct. While it goes well with just about everything, it doesn't lend itself to particular pairings the way that less complicated sauces do.

Size is always an issue when you buy online. I normally wear a size 10M but I thought these might run a little small. I ordered an 11 because there was no 10.5 option and hoped for the best. The sneaker was just right for the big toe but a little too much room to the sides.  The cushioning was good and the sneakers are light weight, airy, and flexible in the front.  I added a pair of Dr. Scholls cushioned inserts and the sneakers fit perfectly now. They are very comfortable and only time will tell how they hold up. They could a little more arch support otherwise I like them a lot.",

It's not that they aren't gluten free. It's that your body sees the protein in oats as the same protein as gluten because they are very similar in structure. I can't eat oats, my 5 year old can't eat oats, my 8 year old old gets sick from eating certified GF oatmeal but not cereal with oat flour. So, it's not necessarily Cheerios making a false statement or not doing their due diligence,  it's your body can't tolerate oats. The allergist who diagnosed me also had celiac and was the same way. We commiserated over our love of oatmeal cookies.",0

It's not that they aren't gluten free. It's that your body sees the protein in oats as the same protein as gluten because they are very similar in structure. I can't eat oats, my 5 year old can't eat oats, my 8 year old old gets sick from eating certified GF oatmeal but not cereal with oat flour. So, it's not necessarily Cheerios making a false statement or not doing their due diligence,  it's your body can't tolerate oats. The allergist who diagnosed me also had celiac and was the same way. We commiserated over our love of oatmeal cookies.",0

This one is better than the Death Star waffle maker: You get much more even browning (but not in the center well where the Rebel symbol is).The waffles this iron makes do have a cross-sectional thickness that seems to be about the same as models of the ship.  This results in some uneven browning, but I can live with that.If you want the front sponsons and the cockpit to come out right in the finished waffle, you do have to make sure you get some batter in those areas.  Which can be tricky with thick waffle batter.  Still, you'll get some expansion of the batter as the leavening kicks in, but it doesn't seem to fill these areas if there isn't any batter in them.Only thing I'd suggest changing about this iron is to not make that center hole quite so deep.",0

B075X278WZ,"Remington Impact Resistant Hair Dryer, D4200",17.99,2018-04-28T00:00:00Z,The Best Dryer I've Ever Used,4,0,"This is by far the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  I have used it for several months now as I wanted to see how it held up over time.  I wash and dry my hair daily.  I have shoulder length, very thick hair.  I have never had a hair dryer dry my hair as fast as this one.  I use a dryer until my hair is almost dry and let the air finish.  I only have to use this dryer for about 5-minutes to achieve what in the past would take 10 minutes or longer.I've used the dryer every day for almost 4 months.  It works just as well as it did on day one.It's powerful but not heavy.The dryer is between 11 to 12 inches tall.  The handle is 7-inches long; longer than I was used to but it was easy to adapt.  I like the longer handle but had to get used to the location of the flip-switch controls.  It was easy for my fingers to change the setting without me realizing it until I got used to them.The cord is 60-inches (5-feet) not including the GFCI-plug.I use a wall mount hair dryer holder but this dryer has an attached plastic ring on the back of the handle to hang the dryer if needed.The chrome coated parts of the dryer have not flaked, chipped or peeled anywhere.  The chrome and black color matches my cream and black bathroom but would look good with just about any color combinations.This is my favorite hair dryer and I plan on purchasing a spare for when this one quits.Made In China",0

It feels solid and puts out a nice flow of air.  There is plenty of heat, but also an option for lukewarm air.  I love that low heat option, which means I don't need to hold down a button for drying without heat.  The attachments are also nice.  The only downside is that the buttons are easy to accidentally hit while I am moving the hair dryer around my head.  They sit on grip handle, which is just not the best place to have them when they are the type that toggle without much force.  Still, other than this quirk, I think it is a good choice for the price.",0

Here are the issues I have with this product, your mileage may vary:1: The plates are too large.  The resulting waffles will not fit in a standard toaster for reheating.  If the plates were reduced in diameter by about an inch, that would be perfect.2: The lands and grooves do not have enough separation - this reduces the cooking surface area and prevents the waffles from crisping up in the iron, even with the heat control set at max.Those are the two problems with it that need fixing.  If they fix them, they could also make the total distance between the low points on both the upper and lower plates a touch further from each other.With those two adjustments, I'd probably give this unit a five star review.",0

There are lights but they don't seem to function like the manual says they will? I prefer whistle or tone.

B017DQCHRM,Star Wars Death Star Waffle Maker,39.99,2018-02-26T00:00:00Z,Slowly Cooks Very Thin Waffles,2,1,"While it does make a waffle that has the Death Star imprinted on it, the waffles are incredibly thin.  The coolness factor of this item does not outweigh the fact that this is not a very good waffle iron.Despite the waffles being thin, it takes quite a long time for a waffle to be cooked on it.  It's also VERY easy to put too much batter onto the iron and make a huge mess, with batter that drips down inside the machine.The lid isn't very heavy (despite the description saying it's a weighted lid) and I found I had to put something heavy on top to keep the top plate from rising too much once the waffle (finally) starts to cook.After a few uses, I had to disassemble it to clean the batter out from inside the maker and I wound up breaking some of the plastic molded pieces trying to re-assemble the unit.  A very cheap design and you need to be careful not to put too much batter in this maker.",0

For his birthday, I got him this and a Darth Vader apron. He loved the idea! However, he was disappointed when he made the first batch. They were so thin and the grooves werenâ€™t deep enough to let the batter get fluffy and crispy like a waffle. It was more of a dense pancake. Still cute though!",0

Only the middle gets brown and the rest stays pale cream color. Also, the green light on top doesn't work so you have no idea when it is done. The orange light stays on all the time and the green one doesn't light up when done. The overall concept is cool.

Before purchasing these, that was a big concern that never had a definitive answer and every reviewer said they couldn't get it to work. I also had issues with getting this to work originally and I saw all the reviews have stated the same thing that they were only able to use the left one individually but the right one would not work without the left one being on. Out of the box that is the case because the left is default as master and the right is the slave. Meaning that the left one is the one that is connected to your phone and the right ear bud connects to your left ear bud. It took me a couple of tries even after I got the explanation from contacting the seller multiple times to grasp more clarity. What you need to do is turn the right one into a master as well and you do this by turning it on and placing it back in the box and taking it out of the box again and having and holding the power button until you hear it say pairing, once that is accomplished you will see it blinks white/blue and you're able to connect your phone to the ear bud. Also make sure you've unpaired any e18 Bluetooth names before doing this since they use the same Bluetooth name for left and right which makes it a hassle to use them individually but I understand the appeal of doing so.I was skeptical at first about these ear buds doing everything I wanted. The sound quality was not high on my list of things necessary for the ear buds. I don't like to listen to loud music and even working out I only want it at a minimal level that I can set it and not have to strain to hear what I'm listening to or watching.I wanted ear buds that I could use one and my wife could use one but left and right would be connected to our separate devices. I also wanted a device that could be used as a pair when we wanted to watch something together. I also needed to make sure they have some kind of resistance to sweat or light usage near water.I researched and could not find one official waterproof ear bud on the market. I found some that stated water proof but then in the description would say it is an ipx5 which is not close to being waterproof.i wouldn't say they are being fallacious but maybe it's the translation that just went awry.That being said these have held up through my workouts and I sweat like a beast. The audio is clear and the range is very good. The battery has held up well so far and I will update if that changes. I will say if u plan on using both ear buds out of the box they are very easy to setup. Once the right is connected to your phone the left will automatically connect when taken out of the charging box. That being said I would still honestly only pick up another pair if the price drops back down.",0

You will hear only from the left, then only from the right and then the audio bitrate changes. This happens almost always when I am close to a group of people.

I've wanted a pair with individual wireless buds for over a decade, but haven't found anything comparable in previous years for under $350.Sounds quality could be better; it's not as great as everyone seems to make it out to be in the reviews, but it's still very good and certainly as good as one should expect from a $50 pair of wireless headphones.You can't adjust the volume on them, but you can pause and skip to the next song.  Haven't tested the call quality, but I'm sure it's adequate.Very impressed upon first use.  There could be better or higher quality products, but anyone will be impressed with these for the price.",0

It pairs effortlessly with my phone when turned on and the range is shocking. I can walk throughout my apartment even when walls interfere and audio is rarely broken up. The magnetic charger is great as I can slip into the USB on my monitor and load the earbud right to it whenever I leave the office for the day. I can't speak to the advertised battery life but have never had to recharge mid-day while at work.I was extremely puzzled when I first saw these as to why you would sell a single earbud at a time that came with two chargers. I still do not completely understand the double charger offer but I am not going to turn it down. I now have a backup!,0

The elastic band holding the notebook closed is much stronger than I'm used to for notebooks of this cost, and seems like it will hold up for some time.On the inside, the inside cover and first page are un-gridded pages with the Minimalism Art logo and a ""Return to if Found"" label, respectively. I personally love that the first page isn't a sketch page -- I find that I always hate coming back to whatever my first sketch in the book is every time I open my notes, and this avoids that perfectly.The actual grid pages are a soft beige color with a printed light grey grid in standard size. Thusfar, I've found that these colors work well to let you see the grid when you need to or ignore it when you're not looking for it. I haven't yet tried to scan these pages, so I don't know if this grid color will make scanning difficult but I suspect it won't be the case with a quick visual check.Remarkably, the book is bound well enough that the grid lines match up over the spine *on every page*. I usually resign myself to never letting a sketch spill over the spine, but in this case it can be done. As well, the binding leaves a very shallow crevice between the two pages: if you pull the two pages taut, they almost lay flat with each other. I suspect that holding the pages flat in this way would damage the book if you did it frequently, but for the occasional two-page layout it's very neat.I'm not very deep into this notebook yet, so I can't speak on durability yet -- so far it seems like it will hold up very well. If there is an issue at any point, I'll return to this review and note it.",0

I have been looking for a durable notebook that can easily slip in and out of my purse/briefcase while visiting customers to take notes on sales calls and when in meetings and this fits the bill perfectly.  The elastic strap has a fair amount of tension on it and so does not slack over just a few uses on and off.  High quality look and feel to the binding and the paper is thick but not so much so that the book won't lay flat when flipping pages and trying to write on the back side of the page in order to utilize the most out of the pages.

Paper like this drags on a fine nib and the result is a slow sluggish pen traversal across the page. Most fp people love Rhodia for Euro paper or Tomoe River for Japanese paper. Both of these are slick not abrasive surfaces that allow a fountain pen to glide across the page. That is the primary reason we write with fountain pens and then seek the perfect paper and feel triply blessed with an outstanding journal.This is an excellent journal by most standards and I would personally shout its praises IF it contained a higher grade of paper.Q.",0

The notebook feels solid and durable, the paper is thick and smooth, and the ribbon and elastics are well sewn. I love the pen loop on the spine feature, definitely a pro in my book. I use mostly fine liners and water based markers and they all work great without ghosting. The only pen I have tried that showed through to the other side is, not surprisingly, a sharpie.There are no real cons, only my personal preference; someone else might like these features: The paper is comparatively dark, more ivory even than a Leuchtturm, and the dots in the grid are quite large. I've been using this journal for 7 weeks now and I'm still not used to the paper color and noticeable dots.

B06VSSKQC9,Cornell 5/8/77,18.99,2017-09-07T00:00:00Z,Best Show They Ever Played?...No.,4,1,"This is a good show, no question about it.  I've had this show on cassette and then CD for more than 25 years, and now finally the band was able to regain possession of the original tapes and we have an official release.  This show was released as part of a boxed set that also contained the shows from May 5th, May 7th and May 9th, and it was also given an individual release.  The songs most talked about from this show are the Scarlet > Fire medley, Dancing In The Street, Estimated Prophet, St. Stephen and Morning Dew.  The Scarlet > Fire is in my top two ever, the other being Portland '77.  Dancing In The Street is the 'disco-fied' version they'd been playing since 1976, and I don't understand the attraction; it's just awful.  The Estimated Prophet is one of the all-time best versions, as are many from the early part of 1977.  I also fail to understand the popularity of the post-hiatus versions of St. Stephen, they were uniformly awful after the song was re-commissioned in 1976.  It just wasn't a good fit for that line-up, at that time, with that repertoire.  They put it back on the shelf shortly thereafter and it wasn't heard again until 1983, and after a few airings it was put away for good...and I do mean for good.  Lastly, we have Morning Dew.  It's hard to find a truly bad version of that song, and this isn't one of them.  It's a good vocal performance from Garcia, and the quality of the recording doesn't hurt either.  The reason I brought up these few songs is to point out the fact that there were 13 more songs played at the show and I rarely hear a word about them.  Aside from the fact that the version of Loser may be the very best they ever played, that leaves a whole bunch of other songs that rarely get a mention...and this show is often touted as 'The Best Show They Ever Played'.  It isn't.  If you can get your hands on the Buffalo show from May 9th, get that one; I prefer it over this show every time.  I can't get real excited about a show when roughly 25% of it is acknowledged as 'great' and the rest of it is largely ignored.  The Buffalo show starts out great and maintains a high level of proficiency throughout the entire show, song after song after song.  Get this one for the highlights, there are quite a few.  But get the Buffalo show if you want consistent greatness throughout.",0

If your a fan of the GD, or are new to the Dead and are looking to find an album to start your collection, please donâ€™t pass this up.

In preface, know that I'm a big fan of the GD, have an excellent collection of shows, and know a good mastering job from a bad one. This, friends, is really bad, and to say I that was disappointed by this release is a severe understatement. The mastering here is plain AWFUL! Voices are well into the background and almost undiscernable, bass boom is just about intolerable, and the instruments sound bunched together with little, if any separation. From a performance perspective, the band is great, notwithstanding Donna's typical, off-key howling and screetching. But, really ... who approved this terrible mastering job? It's virtually unlistenable, and that's a real shame. Moreover, the packaging is very poor; typical lousy, cheap cardboard with nothing to prevent the discs from falling out or hitting into each other. For a show that's in the Library of Congress and has been called the GD's best, one would think that more care would have been taken in the mastering and presentation. Don't waste your money on this one, folks.",0

B000QZVC4W,Bedtime For Democracy,9.49,1999-01-05T00:00:00Z,Absolutely the best,5,0,"By far the best DK album. This was my first DK album and still the best. Some many poignant songs full of bitter sarcasm stabbing in the eye of the state of the union. Sure, Jello has an irritating nasal voice and can't  carry a tune in a bucket. Who cares? All of that talent is wasted on the  lovey-dovey government-friendly top-40 radio songs. If you're tired of  hearing about the ""alternative"" to modern music, and want to hear  what is really going on between people and government, then get this cd.  SOme of the songs are very 1980's linked, but others are timeless. Check  out Chickens**t Conformist. It speaks volumes (literally) about how punk  kids treat each other and get treated by others.  also check out his spoken  word albums.  There is a lot of influence from other bands in their work.  ALot of CRASS and hyper-left/ anrchist-peace punk. DK are the best rounded  blues-influenced punk to come out of America. this cd defines what  (anti)political punk is all about. Check out ""In god we trust  incorporated"", too.",0

But compared to the band's previous array of concept albums, this is a sloppy rush job.  Feels like they're trying to squeeze all their material onto one last hurrah. Too bad, because filler like ""One-Way Ticket to Pluto"" buries some real classics. Music and lyrics only truly come together for ""Frankenchrist"" and ""Lie Detector."" All that being said, this disc is still a buzzsaw through the cable holding up elevator music and all its trappings. Faded brilliance is still brilliance.--J. Ruch END",0

B000QZVC4W,Bedtime For Democracy,9.49,2001-02-06T00:00:00Z,The absolute worst DK album,1,0,"I love the DKs - Fresh Fruit.., Convienience.., Plastic Surgery.., and In God we Trust Inc. are absolutely killer albums. Not just for their lyrical content but for the tunes. Although rightfully labelled a punk band, the DKs music are more similar to the Pixies and Nirvana than Crass or the Sex Pistols. All of their best tracks (Buzzbomb, California Uber Alles, Soup is Good Food, Trust Your Mechanic etc.) thunder along with deep rumbling basslines and technically great guitar work over Jello's offbeat lyrics.However, this albums is absolute s-h-i-t-e. I bought this album after buying all of their first albums (I'd been wary of the crappy black and white cartoon cover) and I was sickened by it's quality. When an album has this many short songs, you're almost guarenteed quantity over quality. The lyrics (and even the song names - Ticket to Neptune, Rambozo the Clown) are depressingly unimaginative compared to, say, their P.S.D. album. Fast, noisy dirges with Jello in ultra-boring-political mode make up this album (you could sorta see it on the horizon. Compare Fresh Fruit to FrankenChrist to illustrate my point).Buy all their early albums for good loud tuneful 'rock' (I guess) music that doesn't require dull lectures about politicians to get the message across.:|",0

This album has it all: the serious political and social commentary, the fast music, the kind of creepy lyrics, and even the re-written version of ""Uber Alles"" named ""We've Got a Bigger Problem Now."" (""Uber Alles"" was about Jerry Brown possibly being President, ""Problem"" is about Regean actually being President). This album defines punk rock. Anti-establishment. Fast music.

Comparing this album to, say, Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables, it seems like a completely different band with a similar lead singer. The songs on this album are very similar, very short and very hardcore compared to the other albums. The lyrics are great but not as great - what happened to rhyming? Jello used to rhyme so well and on this album, there are hardly any rhymes at all! Another annoying thing about this album is the production - songs like ""The Great Wall"" could have been classics from the In God We Trust, Inc. EP if the production had not been so lousy. Jello's voice has a sort of echo effect applied to it which worked on Frankenchrist because the songs were mid-tempo. It doesn't work on this record though, and it becomes slightly annoying after a while. It's a shame that the best song on this album is a cover, ""Take This Job and Shove It"". Other standouts include ""Do the Slag"", ""Anarchy For Sale"" and ""Chickensh*t Conformist"" but the other 17 (!) songs seem to be filler. Only for hardcore fans or people with lots of money to spare. Get any album before this, ""Give Me Convenience.."" or any of the live albums before getting this.",0

Wore them out, too.In 1986, I bought ""Frankenchrist."" Listened to it about a dozen times; maybe 3 or 4 times since.Then, in 1987, I bought ""Bedtime for Democracy"" on casette. Listened to it once. Have not heard it since.Songs like ""Moral Majority,"" ""Kill the Poor"" and ""Well Paid Scientist,"" ""I Am the Owl"" -- though political -- were cool, because they were funny and had catchy tunes. But, ""Frankenchrist"" and ""Bedtime for Democracy"" just became Jello's long-harangue.The more DK ran out of musical ideas, the preachier Jello Biafra became.  Whine, whine, whine on his soapbox, about the Reagan administration, about poseurs taking over the ""punk rock movement.""  Yawn!""Bedtime for Democracy"" is Jello's second spoken word album, the first being ""Frankenchrist."" His bandmates provided the background music to his diatribes, but the band broke up shortly thereafter.Now that they've gone onto other things, Jello has the honesty to call his spoken word CDs by their proper name.

B000QZVC4W,Bedtime For Democracy,9.49,2005-09-12T00:00:00Z,Bedtime for the Kennedys...,2,0,"A slab of raging hardcore punk, the Dead Kennedy's final album, ""Bedtime for Democracy"", is probably in many ways a response to the disasterous affair conduceted during the investigation of ""Frankenchrist"".  Whereas that album reached through different forms and really expanded the vocabulary of the band, musically, this one focuses on aggressive punk sounds, and doesn't really settle down until halfway through the record.  But the pace and intensity picks back up and pretty much sustains for the rest of the album (the exception being Biafra's spoken ""A Commercial"", absolutely brilliant in its sarcasm).The net result is I'm always inclined to feel this is really the weakest album in the Dead Kennedys' catalog.  Mind you, had it been a different band, I'd've rated it higher, but compared to the earlier material, it really pales.",0

B000QZVC4W,Bedtime For Democracy,9.49,2007-09-23T00:00:00Z,Another DKs masterpiece,5,1,"I was prompted to write a review of ""Bedtime For Democracy"" mainly due to all of the other reviews on Amazon deeming it to be a weak album.  In my mind there is no such thing as a weak Dead Kennedys album.  They are all classics in my book.  And furthermore, I would even elevate ""Bedtime..."" a little bit above the ""In God We Trust, Inc."" EP and even ""Plastic Surgery Disasters.""  It's that good.  I feel that this album was pretty much the last glimmer of light at the end of the original punk era.There is always a backlash from longtime fans when an underground band begins to get popular, and the previous year's ""Frankenchrist"" did get the DKs the attention of a lot of mainstream, otherwise non-punk fans, causing many hardcore ""purists"" to label the band ""sell-outs"" or that they had lost their original vision.  All of us who know and love ""Frankenchrist"" know better, but the album did deviate from many ""rules"" of hardcore in that it featured only 10 songs and generally longer ones (though the band had already started to lean in this direction on ""Plastic Surgery Disasters"").  I feel that ""Bedtime..."" was created in many ways in response to these naysayers.  This album after all featured 21 songs, most short and to the point in the hardcore tradition.And unlike the trend of 1986 for hardcore bands to go metal (they called it ""crossover""), there is not a trace of metal to be found on ""Bedtime..."" or any other DKs record for that matter.Now, to go into the songs themselves, things get off to a brilliant, high speed start with opener ""Take This Job and Shove It.""  I am blown away!  Classic Dead Kennedys.  The pace never lets up from there.Some of the most exhilarating tracks are to be found on side 2 of the original LP -- you get classics like ""One-Way Ticket To Pluto,"" ""Do The Slag,"" and ""Chickens**t Conformist,"" Jello Biafra's commentary on the hypocrisy of the punk scene (""Harder core than thou for a year or two/Then it's time to get a real job""), which starts off slow and erupts into brilliant punk fury.  ""Potshot Heard 'Round The World"" continues in similar fashion.  One of the absolute crown jewels of the album though, and right up there with the best DKs songs of all time, is ""Where Do Ya Draw The Line,"" a song so good that it is healing to the soul.  I got up and danced around the room during it when previewing the album as preparation for this review.All in all, another classic for the DKs and way unfairly maligned by many, including many fellow Amazon reviewers.  The only thing disappointing about ""Bedtime For Democracy"" is that it was the DKs' last album.  Who knows what more great music they could have still made, but with this album they sure exited in top form.",0

Try as I may, I hate Bedtime. The lyrics and playing are great, but it just doesn't stand up to the other releases. I wonder if the legal stuff and a contract resulted in a rushed album. I listened to it again a couple days ago with fresh ears and still hate it. The others (including the live one) are still great and relevant though. If you are new to DK and are wondering what to buy, get Fresh Fruit or Plastic Surgery Disasters- both are great examples of what DK were about. Avoid Bedtime though.",0
B000QZVC4W,Bedtime For Democracy,9.49,2010-12-25T00:00:00Z,Don't Worry About the Government,5,0,"The incredible swirling of government vultures, the obscenity lawsuit, a hardcore scene becoming increasingly violent and personal/professional drama would have been a toxic brew for most bands, but the Dead Kennedys let loose one last time with massive doses of societal satire (""Hop With the Jet Set,"" ""Shrink""), powerful political pontifications (""Rambozo the Clown,"" ""Potshot Heard 'Round the World"") and pointed commentary on the shallowness of pop culture (""Dear Abby,"" ""Macho Insecurity,"" ""D.M.S.O."") that artfully scream defiance over 21 tracks that show an evolving musical growth even as the lights faded out before the album was released in November 1986.After touring ceased in February 1986, the group returned to the studio during the summer to record what was the final album. The incredible cover of David Allan Coe's ""Take This Job and Shove It"" and ""Anarchy for Sale"" are about disillusionment as much as disappointment, though Jello Biafra's spoken word ""A Commercial"" - coupled with the excellent album cover - become the central thrust on the biting commentary surrounding this ""Greed is Good"" era.""Lie Detector"" is a fitting final flurry on themes that never really go away; only the names change on the badges worn by the puppets.

Even though there are 21 songs here, in my opinion there are no fillers. Lots of creativity here. I listen to this album all the way through without skipping any songs, they are all aggressive and well thought out. This is easily the best recorded album: drums loud and clear, vibrant guitars, colorful vocals, thick bass--polar opposite of the poorly produced 'Fresh Fruit.' These are the most conscious lyrics in any of their albums, challenging all paradigms, even critical of the punk movement. Songs like 'Jet Set,' 'Macho Insecurity,' 'I Spy,' 'Rambozo,' 'Cesspools' and 'Triumph of the Will' are absolutely brilliant. Much of the material here is so aggressive and competently played that it borders on thrash. Some fans say this album is too different from their other ones (and not as friendly)--to them I say Dead Kennedys should be applauded for were pushing boundaries and not staying stagnant.

BUT STILL F....G GOOD !!!,4,0,"I used to hate this album back in the day, thinking the style had changed too much compared to their predecessors, and it had, and that's exactly the charm. I dismissed it after the first listen and sold the record to a friend. I now realize it's a good album; I bought it again and liked it !!Not every song is a corker like on the others, but at 49' and 21 songs, this sped-up, thrashy-sounding, furious slab of plastic kept my foot tapping most the time. Gone is the jazz influence and the style, if faster and more aggressive than before, with shorter songs, retains the pollitically turbo-charged  lyrics that would infuriate a republican to no end.This is the only remaster I own, for I have original CDs and vinyl for the others, and can't remember how my early version sounded, so I won't compare. I have a very revealing system, and found that on some of the songs the guitar tone is too much to take, so jagged you could cut yourself with, and had to kick down a notch on the 2-4khz zone of my equalizer to tolerate it. Whether this is due to the remastering or not I can't tell, but since it was remastered by the original sound engineer, I'd tend to think the guy didn't take this off balance. Also the cymbals are somewhat faintly mixed-in; no biggie though.The drums and bass guitar have a meaty bottom end that allowed me to play 14 of the songs without the aid of my subwoofer. Vocals are incredibly spot-on.Would not say this is a must-have, but if you love the Kennedys let's say it's a nice optional to round up their discography. I for one am glad I own it again.",0

Even when this cassette was new, most of Jelloâ€™s rapid-fire delivery went right on by because just like death metal growling, itâ€™s just a sound effect to me.Iâ€™m more into the overall sound, versus any candyrock psychedelic profundities, so whatever heâ€™s blathering on about, I could care less. Well, Iâ€™ve picked up a smidgen here and there like that commercial and bits of Take This Job And Shove It. Or, where they slow down a bit and I bother to listen to what heâ€™s saying.As for the music, there are a few interesting things here and there, but to me, nothing to write home about. I prefer heavier stuff though there are â€œmoments,â€� just not enough of them or enough accumulated in one song, vocals combined, to make for a very compelling listen except as a novelty.Just not my thing, though itâ€™s definitely unique and interesting in a way.So far, itâ€™s my one and only punk album and will probably stay that way.",0

Burdon  takes his cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black"", bad  enough in its earlier incarnation as one of the few weak spots in the album  ""Winds Of Change"" (with The Animals), but here it metastasizes  into a multi-theme suite. As in Eric Burdon, the Aaron Copland of R &  B. Not content with that, he does soemthing similar with the Moody Blues'  ""Nights In White Satin"". And to top it off, this album was a  two-LP set in its original vinyl. Remember those days? A double LP set that  wasn't live cost the same as two albums.

Interestingly, I still have never heard a single comment about what African-Americans thought about this song.  I'm white and I love the song. The rest of the album was definitely disappointing, although a few songs have a nice Caribbean sound with guiro, like ""Pretty Colors."" The cover songs ""Paint It Black"" and ""Nights in White Satin"" are pointlessly long, too loosely structured, and add no new interest; they seem like trashy afterthoughts meant only as filler.

The Black-Man's Burdon didn't produce any hits, but it did showcase the raw power of War itself. Although Burdon's rhetoric is held somewhat in check here, it still manages to get in the way of the band at times on this 1970 MGM release. Eric Burdon & War's second offering (a double LP) would also be their last together. Burdon would never sound this poignant in his career again, and Spill The Wine (from Burdon declares ""War"") would be remembered as the only relevant material Burdon performed in the post-Animals era.A point worth mentioning is that it's War's noodling (The Bird And The Squirrel and Nuts, Seeds & Life) in the wake of the classic Beautiful New Born Child that hold your attention. Setting you up for the relentless Out Of Nowhere (that should've been released as a single). In the twilight of the hippie era Jerry Goldstein produced some of the most social and introspective material of the year. Gun hints at a country sick and tired of the Vietnam conflict, while Sun/Moon soothes the listener for the pop sounding Pretty Colors. War's innovative fusion sound would carry them through the entire decade of the 70's, producing a string of 8 gold records in a row.olofpalme63",0

I have many albums for which time has changed my perception, from abslute fan to reasonably enthusiastic, or less. This is (together with the previous album Eric Burdon Declares War) an abolute master piece, never fails to give me intense satisfaction and pleasure.I also had the privilege to see them on stage in Paris in the early 70s, a 4 hours concert taking place after the ""regular"" show at the Olympia Theater. The musicians and the audience were so hot (and high) that the band wouldn't leave the stage. The staff cut the amps, and the concert continued for one hour all acoustic.

There is a little clear band on the outside of the major diameter of the CD, and i believe its from the manufacturer, which im highly suspicious of.

I turned the volume up all the way and it was library worthy, could hear it only if there was no traffic outside or birds chirping.  And the guitar sounded like a synthesizer, which was very wierd.

B004EEWD62,The Black-Man's Burdon,9.49,2015-05-15T00:00:00Z,WHEN BURDONS WAR ERUPTED!!!,5,0,"This is one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Eric Burdon left the San Fran Animals in 1969 and wanted a diverse collection of jazz and funk musicians to swing with, what he found was the band War and they recorded Eric Burdon Declares in '69. That one has stayed in the memories of the public, sort of, with tracks appearing on Animals Best of packages and so forth, but for some reason THIS, the bands second album BLACK MANS BURDON is somewhat lost in the cracks, which is nothing less than a shame, given how amazingly it comes off once you spin it.Basically I dig The Animals and Eric Burdon a ton, which in its phases was both heavy duty real ace bar rock and roll and then some weirdo flower power stuff that hasnt translated so great overt time. WAR brought the life back to Eric Burdons sound, with a full large funky groove. You got horns, flutes, keys, and a whole array of percussions, groovy ladies in the background, and then Eric Burdon. Perhaps you know Spill the Wine or Tobacco Road from 'Declares'... those are great, but I would have to say that while that first album does its best at testing the water, what you find on this, is them fully understanding the water and then parting the sea.As a two disc vinyl I appreciate each side, for having its own groove. Side one represents the Paint it Black Medley, Side Two is a homage to Nights in White Satin... these songs are not traditional covers, they break them apart and experiment wildly with them, given that these songs were probably never in the repetoire of War before Eric Burdon, the band does everything to make it their own...and succeed!!!  The other sides have their own things happening as well. As a LP enthusiast I deeply like double LPS where every side counts, it does with Black Mans Burdon.  Trust me, the entire hour and a half is fully engaging and wild, I think this may be the best thing to ever come out of Eric Burdon or War, and I really like most of the other stuff.",0

War is the perfect backup band for Eric, but they are even better Solo see the World is a ghetto. However this is a great album on its own.

I really like it; but it's probably not for everyone.  Recorded / released in 1970, this album reflects some of the musical trends that were prevalent at the time: Blues, Rock, Jazz, Latin, Psychedelic...  There are others, Santana to name one, that married these influences to greater success; but this album deserves a listen if only for the quality of the musicianship.  Eric Burdon is an excellent vocalist; but it's really WAR that carries the weight here.  Eric Burdon was still in a Trippy Psychedelic phase during this time - probably a little out of sync with the direction of WAR - so you get an interesting hybrid.  This album might have the greatest appeal to fans of the early 70's music, where there we so many musical styles being explored / merged.  In the context of the period, this is an interesting and mostly enjoyable album.",0

There's no list of musicians, just composers' credits, which interestingly omit Eric Burdon completely (erroneously or deliberately, I wonder?).I don't understand why anyone would want to buy such an incomplete package. If you're only interested in the music, a download will do. If you want the album with all the elements that historically should be part of it, this version leaves a lot to be desired.PS: I can't help wondering if the picture that adorned the inside of the original gatefold was omitted on purpose, since it really is in dubious taste. Back in the day, Robert Christgau's scathing review of the album solely consisted of a description of the album cover, with particular emphasis on that picture.PPS: As far as I can make out, the CD's have not been re-mastered, but the original mastering sounds acceptable to me - not great, but pretty close to the sound of the vinyl, which wasn't perfect to begin with.",0

B00123IB78,Europe '72 [Live],13.49,2017-02-06T00:00:00Z,Essential Dead,5,1,"This album is a classic and a must-have for Deadheads and Touchheads alike. Every song is fantastic. This was their first tour with Keith Godchaux and their last with Ronald Charles McKernan, so there's an interesting transition taking place. Hurts Me Too with Pigpen on vocals is the last blues song they would do until the late 80s, and he also delivers a fantastic Mr. Charlie. At the same time, Keith adds that element that defines their 70s sound. There's a great dynamic happening between Keith's grand piano and Pigpen's organ on He's Gone. The songs are generally upbeat and catchy. There are some jams here as well such as China Cat Sunflower > I Know You Rider, Truckin' > Epilogue, and Prelude > Morning Dew. You can't go wrong with this album. It's long enough to capture the essence, but every song is superbly-executed. This is the album where they really start to coalesce into their 70s incarnation by transcending all of their influences to defy any category but the Grateful Dead.",0
B00123IB78,Europe '72 [Live],13.49,2017-03-13T00:00:00Z,Great Dead,5,0,"This is one of my favorite all time albums, by anybody. Every song a winner. At one time or another I have bought copies on vinyl, 8track, cassette, CD, reel to reel and digital download. If I could only have one Dead album this would be it. The only  thing some people don't like about it is that it isn't really that great a representation of their live sound as it was extensively overdubed. A few tracks have very little of the original live recording left. But the truth is that every record is an illusion, a representation if you will, of a fantasized version of a performer and this album is a perfect fantasy of a Grateful Dead concert circa 1972. If you want a better representation of what this would sound like without the dubs listen to the also excellent companion album Volume Two or of course the Europe 72 complete box set.",0

This one is better than the Death Star waffle maker: You get much more even browning (but not in the center well where the Rebel symbol is).The waffles this iron makes do have a cross-sectional thickness that seems to be about the same as models of the ship.  This results in some uneven browning, but I can live with that.If you want the front sponsons and the cockpit to come out right in the finished waffle, you do have to make sure you get some batter in those areas.  Which can be tricky with thick waffle batter.  Still, you'll get some expansion of the batter as the leavening kicks in, but it doesn't seem to fill these areas if there isn't any batter in them.Only thing I'd suggest changing about this iron is to not make that center hole quite so deep.",0

And then there's the title track, combining the best of all genres of music the Subhumans ever experimented with, tied together by wonderful lyrics and a dozen catchy riffs that disappear almost as soon as they appear, perhaps never to return.

They made it work. They were very talented musicians for punks (this is a faaaar cry from The Ramones) and this is maybe their highlight. The only thing that makes this punk is the Cockney Accent of the Singer.The songs are awesome, and oooh man those titles!

I like punk rock, but certain times more than others. SUBHUMANS have a rich british punk sound that is always enjoyable, so, yeah.. I dig it.My favorite album is definately this one..

It took over 10 minutes to cook my first waffle and it was only fully cooked after I flipped it. Yes I had to flip my waffle in a waffle maker in order to get it to finish cooking.

Here are the issues I have with this product, your mileage may vary:1: The plates are too large.  The resulting waffles will not fit in a standard toaster for reheating.  If the plates were reduced in diameter by about an inch, that would be perfect.2: The lands and grooves do not have enough separation - this reduces the cooking surface area and prevents the waffles from crisping up in the iron, even with the heat control set at max.Those are the two problems with it that need fixing.  If they fix them, they could also make the total distance between the low points on both the upper and lower plates a touch further from each other.With those two adjustments, I'd probably give this unit a five star review.",0

I saw that in the reviews before but I like a smaller pocket, crispier waffle (vs a belgian) so that sounded not to bad to me. But this just does not get crispy on the outside too well. I have only tried one recipe (my favorite family recipe) so maybe I will just have to try some others. Also it does not make a clear signal when the waffle is done. There are lights but they don't seem to function like the manual says they will? I prefer whistle or tone.  I don't normally like to have excess appliances so I wanted this to be my be all end all waffle maker replacement and it is not that.

The coolness factor of this item does not outweigh the fact that this is not a very good waffle iron.Despite the waffles being thin, it takes quite a long time for a waffle to be cooked on it.  It's also VERY easy to put too much batter onto the iron and make a huge mess, with batter that drips down inside the machine.The lid isn't very heavy (despite the description saying it's a weighted lid) and I found I had to put something heavy on top to keep the top plate from rising too much once the waffle (finally) starts to cook.After a few uses, I had to disassemble it to clean the batter out from inside the maker and I wound up breaking some of the plastic molded pieces trying to re-assemble the unit.

I was considering buying the original Arlo cameras but decided I wanted to go with the Arlo Pro 2 to get a full 1080P resolution. These cameras perform very well and have helped us monitor our home remotely for the last month and a half. Arlo sensitivity is amazing and we have been able to keep an eye on our home inside and out with the phone app. I would definitely recommend Arlo Pro 2 to anyone that wanted a quality camera to monitor their home. BTW the battery life has been amazing as one of the cameras still has 80% battery life after almost 2 months of use according to what the Arlo App is telling me as well as using the live video occasionally to make sure it is still working.,0

The Arlo Pro 2 (3 Pack), not to be confused with the Arlo Pro 2 Pack, provided me with coverage of the 3 major entry points to my home with a 1080p resolution. The motion sensors have caught every person walking up.  My only issue is license plate capturing, which cannot be done without 4K resolution (understandable), but this provides peace of mind for sure! Also, the 100 decibel siren is a perfect addition to this system. Loved the app and the free cloud storage, compared to Nest. I do own a Nest thermostat but you cannot beat Arlos value AND the compreable picture resolution!",0

I bought four cameras for outdoor security viewing of my home property. They are so good and the field of vision so extensive (130 degrees) that I'm having difficulty deciding where I want the other two units placed. The Wi-Fi signal is very good and covers my entire 3200 sq ft. home area.  A signal extender is optional. The Internet response with free Basic service is excellent.

I have had the original Arlo system for over two years and have been overall satisfied. I upgraded for a few major reasons: rechargeable batteries, direct power, pre-three second recording when plugged in to AC, local USB recording, two-way audio. I have not had any issues with the Pro 2â€™s and very satisfied with all of the new features.The Pro 2 have a slightly better viewing angle and the 1080p is nice, but I thought the 720p wasnâ€™t bad at all. I do have two Pro cameras with the four Pro 2â€™s, so i have done the comparison. I did not need to pre-three second recording, 1080p, and zone capabilities and went cheap with just the two add-on Pro cameras. The capability to mix/match camera with each of the base station is a plus. Night vision is slightly better on the PRo 2â€™s. (See images:  enclosed patio with no lights, driveway with some outside lights, and backyard with no lights - all cameras are about 10-12 feet high.)So far, I have not had the unexpectedly disconnecting issue as mentioned in other reviews. I was told that a higher internet upload speed/bandwidth is required with the Pro 2 due to the higher resolution. As mentioned on the specs, up to 2 mbps per camera is recommended. I have gigabit internet and the email alerts arrive just as fast as the original Arlo cameras. This tells me the captured video is uploading to the Netgear cloud storage without delays. I like Arloâ€™s alerting and notification options and scheduling flexibility. So far, Arloâ€™s (first gen., Pro, or Pro 2) is a better security system overall compared to Ring and Nest.",0

I picked this camera for the good reviews and past success with Netgear products. An important feature for me was quality motion detection so I installed the cameras so they would have wired power. I have a weak wifi signal where the cameras are located but I get an OK signal from the Netgear base station, a pleasant surprise since the base is located next to my router. The picture is sharp and clear and the free 7 days of recording is nice. The clips that are sent to the cloud back up a few seconds prior to the motion detection trigger, a nice feature. I did happen to see something real time within the defined trigger zone that didn't get captured. Not sure why or how often it happens since it triggers whenever I wander into the detection zone. So why 4 stars instead of 5? They give you 3 rectangles to define the detection zone that doesn't give me the flexibility I need/want to define my zone and exclude areas that get motion that I don't care about. I had a system in a previous house that laid the camera view on a checkerboard with small squares that you could click on to define your zone. That wasn't perfect either but it was a lot closer than this. On the plus side they do seem to be able to filter out (reasonably well) plants blowing in the wind and shadow changes with the time of day. I'm happy, no regrets, would have given it 4 and a half stars if I could. Maybe a future upgrade will enhance the detection zone (or maybe not).",0

The house is in another state 4 hours away, so I canâ€™t just pop over to check on it. His ex-wife moved in with him before he passed away (long story). I had to go to court to enforce his will and evict her from the property. This whole process took months as the courts move slowly. After the eviction, I could finally enter the house and I learned that most of his valuables were stolen. We kept getting reports from the neighbors that questionable people were hanging around the property and load up trailers with his things. I set up the Arlo cameras to catch anything that happens after the eviction. Several blind spots became apparent after I realized that she had broken back into the house and stole more things. I bought another camera to help with blind spots, but there is simple too much space that the cameras donâ€™t detect. The reason I left a 4 star review instead of a 5 star review is because of the limitations of the motion detection. My father had 11 acres, which Iâ€™m not trying to cover everything, but the house, garage, and barn are spaced further apart than the Arlo Pro 2 can cover.

B00B5VR8NK,Angelus Brand Acrylic Leather Paint High Gloss Finisher No. 610 - 4oz,7.89,2017-05-19T00:00:00Z,"Works poorly, would not recommend",2,1,"I applied this to a pair of leather boots hoping to bring out the shine of the leather. I was surprised that there was a product that would permanently adhere to leather and maintain a shine, but I was excited to try it. Well, unfortunately my skepticism was well-merited because while this product did deliver a shine, it was short lasting and easily ruined.I applied several coats of the product, making sure that it dried in between coatings. I noticed right away that it had a little bit of a tack to it. I hoped that tack would go away but it never did. As a result, the boots are now a magnet for debris. Kind of ruins the shine when everything sticks to them. On top of that, the coating is pretty fragile and flakes off easily. As some people have mentioned, it goes on white but dries clear. Well, that's true until it gets scuffed or worn - then it goes right back to an opaque white wherever any tiny abrasion occurs, and with boots, that happens often. If someone stepped on these boots, there'd be a semi-permanent shoe mark on them. What a joke!It's true this product makes things shine and it gives it that wet look, but it comes at a cost of losing the durability of the original material. This product behaves exactly as one would expect acrylic paint to behave - flexible but non-durable and not well suited for clothing.",0

This product is so outstanding in the application process compared to the acrylic resolene that is manufactured by a major competitor. This Angelus product goes on the Latigo strips I use in such a streak free maner, I have just disposed of the gallon container I had in stock and this stuff is not cheap. Speaking of price, I am disappointed that quantities of more than 4 ounces are carried here at my favorite place to shop personal as well as business. But in this case dance a larger quantity is not available, I found that Angelus sells direct on the internet. The prices are better but they do not offer free shipping.

Since this product is supposed to be ""high gloss"", I guess I actually expected a seriously shiny... wait for it... high gloss finish.Sadly, I was disappointed in the lack of gloss! I followed the instructions for application on one (pre-cleaned) shoe first. I didn't see the high gloss finish once the shoe was dry, so I chalked this up to user error. Upon re-reading the instructions and checking Google for application tips/tricks, I went ahead and completed the other shoe of the pair. Still not how I expected ""High Gloss""  to appear once it was dry. The shoes look better than they did before, just not high gloss, really.After that, I tried the same application (over the red-bottom paint) on a few other leather-soled shoes, but with a few variations, feeling like I still must not be doing something correctly. I tried light sanding in between coats (similar to how one would refinish/paint wood, or anything that required excellent adhesion). Nope. I tried adding extra coats. No dice.I've come to the conclusion that a water-based product can't produce a real ""high gloss"" shine, and in this case, the finish this product provides is more gloss than the finish from their matte finish product, so was named accordingly.",0

I want to start this review off by saying that I'm an educator and have been using my Acer Chromebook for over 5 years and it still works great.  The Chromebooks my school uses (not Samsung) also have very few problems.  I bought this Samsung 3 Chromebook on Black Friday from a big box store with the plans to pass my older machine off to my teenager.  The first thing I noticed was that the sound quality is horrible on this compared to my five year old Acer.  One night I was watching Amazon Prime movies and the battery was getting low so I plugged my Samsung Chromebook 3 in to the charger it came with and went to bed.  In the morning I wanted to finish my movie and when I turned it back on the screen was messed up.  I contacted Samsung and described the screen as being blotchy.  They told me there was a 1 year warranty and to send it in.  I did and a week later I got a message saying that the LCD screen was broken and it violated the warranty.  I questioned how I broke it given it was working 100% fine, I plugged it in and set it on a desk to charge, and nobody touched it besides myself (charging in my room).  They said they'd fix it for $168 which is more than I paid for it.  I declined and it was sent back.  I just ordered a generic LCD screen from Amazon and fixed it myself in under 5 minutes.  The generic screen was $32.  I am completely disgusted with Samsung.  This is the fourth product from Samsung that I have had issues with ($3600 designer fridge, $1500 laundry pair, and also a microwave$350 microwave).  I've had extended protection warranties on all my other Samsung purchases, but due to the nature of having to buy quick for Black Friday (sells out in seconds) I didn't get an extra warranty.  I will never buy Samsung anything again.  I definitely would not buy this again.",0

It's really annoying when I'm running and have to reconnect. They are fully charged and it's not a battery issue. They just won't stay connected to my phone. Must be a durability issue.,0

At about 11 months of owning one of the earbuds simply stopped working. The support site states you have to return not just the headphones but the box, manual and all accessories. I donâ€™t know many people who would still have the box almost a year later but I certainly donâ€™t. Bought a different brand with much more customer friendly policies. Very happy now",0

We were able to get a replacement for two pair but the last two, no dice.  They begin to not sync with any bluetooth device.  Then it won't recharge and eventually just dies.  This happened on all of ours.  You would think after FOUR times they'd realize their product is not good and at least offer our money back.  Don't waste your money or trouble on this product.  We have learned!",0
